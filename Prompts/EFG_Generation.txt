The CODE for representing the imperfect information of the game is as follows:

Avoid using recursion or loops in the code generation.  
Refrain from using the ``+'' operator in the code generation.  
Note that `g.append_move', `g.append_infoset', `g.set_outcome', and `g.set_infoset' all return `None'.  
Make sure to call `g.set_infoset(node1, node2.infoset)' only after `g.append_move' has been executed on both `node1' and `node2'.  
Use `gbt.Rational' to represent probabilities at the chance node. 

Then, could you write python code to generate the EFG for this game using the pygambit library in the example?
Letâ€™s think step by step and write the reasoning in the code comments.
