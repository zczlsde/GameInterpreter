This code constructs the extensive-form game as described, with Alice and Bob making sequential decisions about whether to take or push the piles of coins. The game tree is built step by step, with outcomes assigned based on the players' actions. Information sets are used to represent the imperfect information in the game, ensuring that Bob's and Alice's decisions are grouped appropriately.

### Explanation:
- The game starts with Alice, who can either take the larger pile or push the piles to Bob.
- If Alice takes the pile, the game ends with her receiving 4 coins and Bob receiving 1 coin.
- If Alice pushes, the piles double, and Bob can either take the larger pile or push them back to Alice.
- If Bob takes the pile after Alice's push, he receives 8 coins and Alice receives 2 coins.
- If Bob pushes, the piles double again, and Alice can either take the larger pile or push them back to Bob.
- If Alice takes the pile after Bob's push, she receives 16 coins and Bob receives 4 coins.
- If Alice pushes again, the piles double once more, and Bob can either take the larger pile or push them back to Alice.
- If Bob takes the pile after Alice's second push, he receives 32 coins and Alice receives 8 coins.
- If Bob pushes again, the piles do not double, and the game ends with Alice receiving the larger pile (64 coins) and Bob receiving the smaller pile (16 coins).
