### Explanation:

1. **Game Initialization**: We start by creating a new extensive-form game with two players, A and B.

2. **First Move by A**: A proposes a plan where A receives 5,500 pounds and B receives 4,500 pounds. B has the choice to either accept or reject this proposal.

3. **B's Decision**:
   - If B accepts, the game ends with the proposed split, and the payoffs are set accordingly.
   - If B rejects, B proposes an equal split of 5,000 pounds each.

4. **A's Decision**:
   - If A accepts B's proposal, both players receive 4,750 pounds.
   - If A rejects, A proposes a new split where A receives 5,200 pounds and B receives 4,800 pounds.

5. **Final Move by B**: B has no choice but to accept A's second proposal, resulting in a different payoff.

6. **Outcome Setting**: We set the outcomes for each terminal node based on the decisions made by the players.

7. **Save the Game**: Finally, we save the extensive-form game in the native format.```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with players A and B
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["A", "B"], title="Negotiation Game")

# A proposes the initial distribution plan
g.append_move(g.root, "A", ["Propose 5500/4500"])

# B decides to accept or reject A's proposal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "B", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If B accepts, the game ends with payoffs 5500 for A and 4500 for B
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([5500, 4500], label="B accepts A's proposal"))

# If B rejects, B proposes an equal split
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "B", ["Propose 5000/5000"])

# A decides to accept or reject B's proposal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], "A", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If A accepts B's proposal, the game ends with payoffs 4750 for both
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([4750, 4750], label="A accepts B's proposal"))

# If A rejects B's proposal, A proposes a new plan
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1], "A", ["Propose 5200/4800"])

# B must accept A's new proposal, ending the game with payoffs 4693 for A and 4332 for B
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([4693, 4332], label="B accepts A's new proposal"))
