### Explanation:
1. **Game Setup**: We start by creating a new extensive-form game with two players: Firm 1 and Firm 2. The game is titled "Monopoly Entry Game".

2. **Firm 2's Decision**: Firm 2, the potential competitor, moves first. It has two actions: "Enter" or "Stay Out". This is represented by appending a move to the root node for Firm 2.

3. **Firm 1's Decision**: If Firm 2 decides to enter, Firm 1, the monopolist, must decide whether to "Fight" or "Accommodate". This is represented by appending a move to the node where Firm 2 has chosen to enter.

4. **Payoffs**:
   - If Firm 2 stays out, Firm 1 earns a payoff of 3, and Firm 2 earns 0.
   - If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 accommodates, both firms earn a payoff of 2.
   - If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 fights, Firm 2 earns a payoff of 3, and Firm 1 earns 1.

5. **Outcome Setting**: We set the outcomes for each terminal node based on the payoffs described.

6. **Save the Game**: Finally, we save the extensive-form game in the native format.
