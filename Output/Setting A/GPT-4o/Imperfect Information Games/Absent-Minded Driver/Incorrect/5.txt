# The driver first makes a decision at junction X
g.append_move(g.root, "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# If the driver chooses to CONTINUE, they reach junction Y
# At junction Y, the driver again makes a decision
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Set the outcomes for each terminal node
# If the driver exits at junction X, they reach destination A with a payoff of 0

# If the driver exits at junction Y, they reach destination B with a payoff of 4
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([4], label="Destination B"))

# If the driver continues at junction Y, they reach destination C with a payoff of 1
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([1], label="Destination C"))

# Set the information set to reflect the driver's inability to distinguish between junctions X and Y
# Both nodes where the driver makes a decision (junction X and Y) are in the same information set

### Explanation:
- **Game Setup**: We define a game with one player, the "Driver", who makes decisions at two junctions, X and Y.
- **Moves**: The driver has two choices at each junction: "EXIT" or "CONTINUE".
- **Outcomes**: 
  - Exiting at junction X leads to destination A with a payoff of 0.
  - Exiting at junction Y leads to destination B with a payoff of 4.
  - Continuing at junction Y leads to destination C with a payoff of 1.
- **Imperfect Information**: The driver cannot distinguish between junctions X and Y, so both decision nodes are placed in the same information set.
- **Code Structure**: The code follows the structure of defining moves, setting outcomes, and handling imperfect information using the `pygambit` library.
