This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representation of a specific Tic-Tac-Toe game state using the pygambit library. The game tree is built based on the current board state and possible moves, with outcomes determined by the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe (three in a row wins). The game is asymmetric, with "Player X" moving first under the given conditions. The outcomes are set based on whether "Player X" or "Player O" wins, or if the game continues with further moves.
