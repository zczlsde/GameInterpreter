This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representation of a specific Tic-Tac-Toe scenario using the pygambit library. The game tree is built based on the current board state and possible moves, with outcomes determined by the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is asymmetric, with "Player X" moving first under the given conditions. The outcomes are set based on whether placing a mark leads to an immediate win for either player.
