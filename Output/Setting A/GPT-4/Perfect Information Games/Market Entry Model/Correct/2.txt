```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with two players: Firm 1 and Firm 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Firm 1", "Firm 2"], title="Market Entry Game")

# Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out
# This is the first move in the game, and it's made by Firm 2
g.append_move(g.root, "Firm 2", ["Enter", "Stay Out"])

# If Firm 2 enters, then Firm 1 must decide how to respond
# This decision is represented by a move for Firm 1 with two actions: Fight or Accommodate
# This move is contingent on Firm 2 choosing to Enter
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Firm 1", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])

# Now, we define the payoffs based on the game description
# If Firm 2 stays out, the game ends, and Firm 1 earns more (we assume this to be a payoff of 2 for Firm 1 and 0 for Firm 2)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], g.add_outcome([2, 0], label="Firm 2 Stays Out"))

# If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 fights, Firm 2 earns more than Firm 1 (we assume payoffs of 0 for Firm 1 and 2 for Firm 2)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 2], label="Fight"))

# If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 accommodates, both firms earn an equal amount (we assume payoffs of 1 for both firms)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, 1], label="Accommodate"))

# Since the game does not involve simultaneous moves or imperfect information as described,
# we do not need to use g.set_infoset() for this particular game setup.

# Save the EFG

This code snippet creates an extensive-form game representing the strategic interaction between a monopolist (Firm 1) and a potential entrant (Firm 2). The game captures the decision of Firm 2 to enter or stay out of the market and the subsequent decision of Firm 1 to either fight or accommodate the entry. The payoffs are set according to the game description, reflecting the outcomes of these strategic choices.
