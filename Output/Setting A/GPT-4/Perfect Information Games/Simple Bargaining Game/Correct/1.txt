```python

# Create a new game with two players, A and B
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["A", "B"], title="Negotiation Game")

# Step 1: A proposes a distribution plan (5500 for A, 4500 for B)
# This is the only action at this stage, so we move directly to B's decision
g.append_move(g.root, "A", ["Propose 5500-4500"])

# Step 2: B decides whether to accept or reject A's initial proposal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "B", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If B accepts, the game ends with the proposed distribution
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([5500, 4500], label="B Accepts Initial"))

# If B rejects, B proposes an equal split (5000 each)
# Since the proposal is automatic and only one action is available, we move to A's decision
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "B", ["Propose 5000-5000"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], "A", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If A accepts B's proposal, the negotiation ends with a slightly different distribution due to negotiation costs
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([4750, 4750], label="A Accepts Counter"))

# If A rejects B's proposal, A proposes a new plan (5200 for A, 4800 for B)
# Since B has no right to reject, this ends the game
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1], "A", ["Propose 5200-4800"])

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the negotiation process between players A and B over the division of 10,000 pounds. The game proceeds through a series of proposals, where player A makes the initial proposal, and player B can accept or reject it. If B rejects, B makes a counter-proposal, to which A can respond. The final proposal by A is automatically accepted by B, concluding the game. The payoffs at each terminal node reflect the outcomes of the negotiation, taking into account the costs of negotiation in terms of the final amounts received by each player.
