This code snippet creates an extensive-form game representing the scenario with Alice and Bob and their decisions regarding the piles of coins. The game tree is constructed step by step, with each player's decision leading to different outcomes. The outcomes are set based on the description, where players can either take the current piles or push them to the other player, doubling the piles' sizes. The game ends after a series of moves, with the final outcome depending on the players' decisions throughout the game.
