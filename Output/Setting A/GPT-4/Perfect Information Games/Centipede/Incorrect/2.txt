# If Alice pushes, the piles double and it's Bob's turn
# Bob can then decide to take the now doubled piles or push them back

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the scenario with Alice and Bob and their decisions regarding two piles of coins. The game tree is built step by step, reflecting each player's choices at each stage of the game. The outcomes are determined by the actions taken by the players, with the final outcome also considering the rule that if no one takes the piles, Alice gets the larger pile after the last push.
