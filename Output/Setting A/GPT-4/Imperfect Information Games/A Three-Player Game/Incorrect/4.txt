This code constructs an extensive-form game with three players and a chance event at the beginning. It carefully sets up the game tree to reflect the sequential decisions and the imperfect information structure as described. Each player's decision node is connected appropriately, and the outcomes are set based on the players' choices. The use of `g.set_infoset` ensures that the game correctly represents the players' lack of knowledge about previous moves and the outcome of the chance event, adhering to the requirements for handling imperfect information.
