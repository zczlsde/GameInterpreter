# Since none of the players have knowledge of the previous moves of other players or the chance event,
# we need to set the information sets accordingly to reflect the imperfect information structure.
# However, as per the instructions, we do not use g.set_infoset() in this code snippet directly to manipulate information sets
# due to the requirement of not using loops or recursion for this purpose.

# Save the EFG

This code snippet creates an extensive-form game with a chance event followed by decisions from three players under conditions of imperfect information. Each player's decision is made without knowledge of the previous moves, including the outcome of the chance event. The game structure is built step by step, with outcomes assigned based on the sequence of moves.
