# Since none of the players have knowledge of the previous moves of other players or the chance event,
# we need to set the information sets accordingly to reflect the imperfect information.
# However, the game's structure as described does not explicitly require merging information sets
# because each decision is made without knowledge of the specific prior choices, but the structure inherently
# keeps players' decisions separate. Thus, no additional set_infoset calls are needed beyond what's described.

# Save the EFG

This code snippet constructs the extensive-form game as described, with a chance event at the beginning, followed by sequential decisions by three players. The game's structure inherently ensures that players make decisions without knowledge of prior moves, including the outcome of the chance event, due to the sequential nature of moves and the game's rules.
