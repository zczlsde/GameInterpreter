# Create a new extensive-form game with one player, the absent-minded driver
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Driver"], title="Absent-minded Driver Game")

# The driver first makes a decision at junction X
g.append_move(g.root, "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# If the driver chooses to CONTINUE, they reach junction Y
# At junction Y, the driver again makes a decision
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Set the outcomes for each terminal node
# If the driver exits at junction X, they reach destination A with a payoff of 0
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0], g.add_outcome([0], label="Destination A"))

# If the driver exits at junction Y, they reach destination B with a payoff of 4
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([4], label="Destination B"))

# If the driver continues past junction Y, they reach destination C with a payoff of 1
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1], label="Destination C"))

# Since the driver cannot distinguish between junctions X and Y, we need to set the same information set for both decision nodes
# This reflects the imperfect information in the game
g.set_infoset(g.root, g.root.children[1].infoset)
