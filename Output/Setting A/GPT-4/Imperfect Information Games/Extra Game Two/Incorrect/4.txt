This code constructs an extensive-form game with three players where the game progresses through four stages with decisions made by different players at each stage. The game incorporates imperfect information by grouping decision nodes for Player 2 and Player 1's second decision under each of Player 1's initial choices, reflecting that Player 2 does not know Player 1's initial choice and Player 1 does not know Player 2's choice when making their second decision.
