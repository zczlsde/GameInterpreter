This code outlines the structure for a three-card poker game between Alice and Bob with imperfect information, as described. The game starts with a chance node determining the allocation of cards, followed by Alice's decision to check or bet. Depending on Alice's action, Bob can then check, bet, fold, or call. The outcomes are simplified and would need to be adjusted based on the actual rules for determining the winner with the specific cards dealt. This code does not implement the logic for comparing the cards to decide the winner, as that would require additional conditions and is not directly supported by the Gambit API's functionality for defining outcomes.
