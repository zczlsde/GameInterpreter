```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with two players
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1"], title="Three-stage game with imperfect recall")

# Stage 1: A chance event decides between "L" or "R" with equal probability.
g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["L", "R"])
# Set the probabilities for the chance moves to 1/2 each.
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.infoset, [gbt.Rational(1, 2), gbt.Rational(1, 2)])

# Stage 2: Player 1 observes the outcome of the chance event and chooses between "l" or "r".
# This happens for both outcomes of the chance event, so we append moves to both children of the root.
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 1", ["l", "r"])

# Stage 3: Player 1 must choose between "A" and "B" without remembering the outcome of the first stage.
# However, she remembers her decision from the second stage.
# We append moves for "A" and "B" to all second-stage decisions.
for node in g.root.children:
    for child in node.children:
        g.append_move(child, "Player 1", ["A", "B"])

# At this point, Player 1's decisions at the third stage should be in the same information set
# if they stem from the same decision at the second stage.
# We use g.set_infoset() to group these decisions into the same information set.
# Grouping decisions after choosing "l" in the second stage.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
# Grouping decisions after choosing "r" in the second stage.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)

# Set all outcomes to have payoffs of 0.
# We iterate through all terminal nodes to set their outcomes.
for node in g.root.children:
    for child in node.children:
        for grandchild in child.children:
            g.set_outcome(grandchild, g.add_outcome([0]))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code constructs an extensive-form game with imperfect recall using the pygambit library. It carefully follows the game's stages, ensuring that Player 1's decisions in the third stage are grouped into the same information set based on their second-stage decisions, reflecting the imperfect recall aspect of the game.
