To model the Rock-Paper-Scissors game as an extensive form game using the pygambit library, we need to consider that both players choose their actions simultaneously. In the context of an extensive form game, simultaneous moves can be represented by creating a chance move that leads to different outcomes, each corresponding to a possible combination of the players' choices. However, since the request specifically mentions not to use a chance move for simultaneous actions and focuses on the use of information sets to handle the imperfect information inherent in simultaneous moves, we will structure the game as follows:

1. Represent the game as if one player (say Player 1) moves first, choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. Then, Player 2 makes their choice, also among Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. Since the moves are actually simultaneous, Player 2's move is made without knowledge of Player 1's move. This is modeled by placing all of Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
4. We will assign payoffs based on the rules: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeat Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. Ties result in a draw.

Here's how the code would look:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with two players
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2"], title="Rock-Paper-Scissors")

# Player 1's move: choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"])

# For each of Player 1's actions, Player 2 chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"])

# Since Player 2's moves are simultaneous with Player 1's, they are in the same information set
# PLEASE BE AWARE, when more than two nodes need to be grouped in the same information set, you should assign all nodes to the infoset of a single node.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[2], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[2], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[1], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[2], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)

# Assign payoffs based on the game rules
# For simplicity, we'll use: Win = 1, Lose = -1, Tie = 0
# Player 1's perspective: [Rock, Paper, Scissors]
# Player 2's perspective: [Rock, Paper, Scissors]
# Example: If Player 1 chooses Rock and Player 2 chooses Scissors, Player 1 wins.
payoffs = {
    ("Rock", "Scissors"): [1, -1],
    ("Rock", "Paper"): [-1, 1],
    ("Paper", "Rock"): [1, -1],
    ("Paper", "Scissors"): [-1, 1],
    ("Scissors", "Rock"): [-1, 1],

    ("Rock", "Rock"): [0, 0],
    ("Paper", "Paper"): [0, 0],
    ("Scissors", "Scissors"): [0, 0]
}

# Loop through each combination of moves to set outcomes
for i, p1_choice in enumerate(["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]):
    for j, p2_choice in enumerate(["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]):
        outcome = g.add_outcome(payoffs[(p1_choice, p2_choice)])
        g.set_outcome(g.root.children[i].children[j], outcome)

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code models the Rock-Paper-Scissors game as an extensive form game with imperfect information, where Player 2's moves are made without knowledge of Player 1's move, represented by placing all of Player 2's decisions in the same information set.
