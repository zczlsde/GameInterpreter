# Since Player 2's decision is based on the interpretation of Player 1's move, which is a chance event,

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game with imperfect information, where Player 1's choice can be misinterpreted by Player 2 due to a chance move. The game tree is built step by step, starting with Player 1's decision, followed by the introduction of chance nodes to model the possibility of misinterpretation, and finally, Player 2's decisions based on the perceived actions of Player 1. The outcomes are set based on the actual choices of Player 1 and Player 2, with payoffs assigned according to the ranking provided.
