# Since the game involves imperfect information due to the misinterpretation by Player 2,

# so additional information set assignments are not needed to reflect imperfect information.

This code constructs an extensive-form game with imperfect information, where Player 1's choice can be misinterpreted by Player 2 with a small probability. The game tree includes chance nodes to model the probability of misinterpretation. The outcomes are determined by Player 1's actual choices and Player 2's responses, with payoffs assigned based on the given ranking.
