```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players, Alexis and Beverley
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alexis", "Beverley"], title="Bach or Stravinsky?")

# Since the game involves simultaneous moves, we model this by introducing a chance move at the root.
# This chance move will lead to two branches, one for each of the possible choices (Bach or Stravinsky) by Alexis.
# We use a chance node to simulate simultaneous moves, as both players make their choice independently and simultaneously.
g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["Alexis chooses Bach", "Alexis chooses Stravinsky"])

# For each outcome of the chance move, we append moves for Beverley to choose between Bach and Stravinsky.
# This creates a tree where Beverley responds to each of Alexis's potential choices.
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Beverley", ["Bach", "Stravinsky"])

# Now, we set the outcomes based on the game description.
# If both choose Bach, Alexis gets a higher payoff, and Beverley gets a lower payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Bach"))
# If both choose Stravinsky, Beverley gets a higher payoff, and Alexis gets a lower payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Stravinsky"))
# If they choose different concerts, neither player receives any payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Alexis Bach, Beverley Stravinsky"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Alexis Stravinsky, Beverley Bach"))

# Since the players make their choices simultaneously and independently, we need to set the information sets accordingly.
# This ensures that the game is represented as having imperfect information, where each player does not know the other's choice.
# We use the identical code provided in the instructions to handle the imperfect information.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')

This code snippet creates an extensive-form game representation of the "Bach or Stravinsky?" game using the pygambit library. The game is modeled with a chance node to simulate the simultaneous decision-making process of the two players, Alexis and Beverley. The outcomes are set based on their preferences for Bach and Stravinsky, and the information sets are configured to reflect the imperfect information inherent in the simultaneous move game.
