This code snippet creates an extensive-form game representation of the "Bach or Stravinsky?" game using the pygambit library. The game involves two players, Alexis and Beverley, making simultaneous choices between attending a Bach or Stravinsky concert. The game is modeled with a chance node to simulate the simultaneous moves, and information sets are used to represent the players' lack of knowledge about the other's choice at the time of decision-making. The outcomes are set based on the preferences of Alexis and Beverley for the concerts, with higher payoffs for attending their preferred concert together and no payoff for attending different concerts.
