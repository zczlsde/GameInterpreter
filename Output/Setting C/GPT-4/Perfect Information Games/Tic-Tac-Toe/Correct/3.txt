```python
# Since "x" and "o" take turns and the game tree branches based on their moves, 
# each decision node for "o" after "x" makes a move is a different information set because "o" knows where "x" has placed its mark.
# However, when "x" makes the next move after "o", "x" has perfect information about the board state.
# Therefore, there's no need to group any nodes into the same information set based on the given game description and current board state.
# The game described does not inherently contain any imperfect information scenarios that require grouping of decision nodes into the same information set for a player.
# Each move provides both players with perfect information about the board state, and the decision nodes follow sequentially from the game's progress.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players: "x" and "o"
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["x", "o"], title="Tic-Tac-Toe")

# The root of the game tree, where "x" makes the first move
# "x" has three possible moves: place mark on (0,0), (0,2), or (1,0)
g.append_move(g.root, "x", ["(0,0)", "(0,2)", "(1,0)"])

# If "x" places the mark on (0,0)
# "o" can then place the mark on (0,2) and (1,0)
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "o", ["(0,2)", "(1,0)"])
# If "o" places the mark on (0,2), "o" wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="o wins"))
# If "o" places the mark on (1,0), "x" can then place the mark on (0,2), "x" wins
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "x", ["(0,2)"])
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="x wins"))

# If "x" places the mark on (0,2), "x" wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="x wins"))

# If "x" places the mark on (1,0)
# "o" can then place the mark on (0,0) and (0,2)
g.append_move(g.root.children[2], "o", ["(0,0)", "(0,2)"])
# If "o" places the mark on (0,0), "x" can then place the mark on (0,2), "x" wins
g.append_move(g.root.children[2].children[0], "x", ["(0,2)"])
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[2].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="x wins"))
# If "o" places the mark on (0,2), "o" wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[2].children[1], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="o wins"))

This code snippet constructs the extensive-form game for the given Tic-Tac-Toe scenario using the pygambit library. It outlines the possible moves and outcomes based on the current board state and the rules provided. Each move is explicitly defined, and outcomes are set according to the game's rules.
