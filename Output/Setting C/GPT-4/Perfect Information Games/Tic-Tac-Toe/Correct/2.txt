```python
# Since "x" and "o" take turns and the game tree branches based on their moves, 
# each decision node for "o" after an "x" move is a unique situation based on the previous move of "x".
# Therefore, there's no need to group "o" decision nodes into the same information set because "o" has perfect information about "x"'s move.
# Similarly, "x" has perfect information about "o"'s move when it's "x"'s turn to move.
# However, if we consider the game from the start, without knowing the moves made, 
# each player does not know the moves the other will make in response to their moves, 
# but this does not translate to imperfect information within the structure of the sequential game as modeled here.
# Each move is made with full knowledge of the past moves, so there are no information sets grouping multiple nodes for the same player.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this game representation.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players: "x" and "o"
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["x", "o"], title="Tic-Tac-Toe")

# The initial board state is given, and "x" is to move next.
# There are three possible moves for "x" based on the current board state.

# Append the initial moves for "x"
g.append_move(g.root, "x", ["(0,0)", "(0,2)", "(1,0)"])

# For each of "x"'s moves, we need to consider the possible responses by "o" and the subsequent moves by "x".

# If "x" places the mark on (0,0)
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "o", ["(0,2)", "(1,0)"])
# If "o" places the mark on (0,2), "o" wins.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="o wins"))
# If "o" places the mark on (1,0), then "x" can place the mark on (0,2) and "x" wins.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "x", ["(0,2)"])
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="x wins"))

# If "x" places the mark on (0,2), "x" wins.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="x wins"))

# If "x" places the mark on (1,0)
g.append_move(g.root.children[2], "o", ["(0,0)", "(0,2)"])
# If "o" places the mark on (0,0), then "x" can place the mark on (0,2) and "x" wins.
g.append_move(g.root.children[2].children[0], "x", ["(0,2)"])
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[2].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="x wins"))
# If "o" places the mark on (0,2), "o" wins.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[2].children[1], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="o wins"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')

This code snippet constructs the extensive-form game for the given Tic-Tac-Toe scenario using the pygambit library. It explicitly models the decision nodes for each player based on the current board state and the possible moves. Each move leads to a new game state, which is either another decision node or an outcome node where the game ends, and the payoffs are assigned based on the winner.
