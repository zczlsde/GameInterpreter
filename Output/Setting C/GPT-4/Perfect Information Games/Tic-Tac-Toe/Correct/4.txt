```python
# Since "x" and "o" take turns and can observe each other's moves, there's no need for information sets grouping multiple nodes based on imperfect information.
# Each move is made with perfect information about the previous moves.
# Therefore, in this specific game scenario, there are no information sets that group nodes based on the players not knowing which node they are at.
# This is because after each move, the state of the game (the board) is fully visible to both players.
# Hence, no set_infoset() function calls are necessary for this game representation.

```python

# e | o | e
# e | x | o
# x | x | o
# "x" has the next move and can place a mark on (0,0), (0,2), or (1,0).

# Append moves for "x" at the root node
g.append_move(g.root, "x", ["(0,0)", "(0,2)", "(1,0)"])
