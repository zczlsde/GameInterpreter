```python
# Since "x" and "o" take turns and the game tree branches based on their moves, 
# each decision node for "o" after "x" makes a move is a different information set because "o" knows where "x" has placed its mark.
# However, when "x" makes the next move, "x" has perfect information about the state of the game.
# Therefore, there's no need to group nodes into the same information set based on the game's description and the current state.
# This game does not have the typical structure of imperfect information for a single player's decision nodes,
# as each player has perfect information when making their moves.
# The imperfect information aspect in typical games (where players might not distinguish between nodes within their decision turn) does not apply here.
# Hence, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this specific game state and description.
```

# e | o | e
# e | x | o
# x | x | o
# "X" has the next move and can place a mark on (0,0), (0,2), or (1,0).

# Append moves for "X" at the root node
