```python
# Since "x" and "o" take turns and the game tree branches based on their moves, 
# each decision node where "x" or "o" has to make a decision is distinct and known to the player making the decision.
# However, the game involves a sequence of moves, not simultaneous moves, 
# so each player knows exactly where they are in the game tree when making a decision.
# Therefore, there's no need to group nodes into information sets based on the inability of a player to distinguish between them.
# In this specific game scenario, each move leads to a unique and identifiable situation for the players,
# so there's no imperfect information within the context of each player's turn.
# Hence, no set_infoset() function calls are necessary for this game representation.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players: "Player X" and "Player O"
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player X", "Player O"], title="Tic-Tac-Toe")

# The current board state is:
# e | o | e
# e | x | o
# x | x | o
# "x" moves next.

# "x" can place the mark on (0,0), (0,2), and (1,0).
# We create decision nodes for "x" at the root for these moves.
x_moves = ["(0,0)", "(0,2)", "(1,0)"]
g.append_move(g.root, "Player X", x_moves)

# If "x" places the mark on (0,0)
# "o" can then place the mark on (0,2) and (1,0).
o_moves_after_x_00 = ["(0,2)", "(1,0)"]
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Player O", o_moves_after_x_00)

# Outcomes after "o" moves
# If "o" places the mark on (0,2), "o" wins.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="O wins"))
# If "o" places the mark on (1,0), "x" can then place the mark on (0,2), "x" wins.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="X wins"))

# If "x" places the mark on (0,2), "x" wins.

This code snippet constructs the extensive-form game representation of the given Tic-Tac-Toe scenario using the pygambit library. Each decision node represents a move by "x" or "o" based on the current board state, leading to outcomes that reflect the game's win, lose, or draw conditions.
