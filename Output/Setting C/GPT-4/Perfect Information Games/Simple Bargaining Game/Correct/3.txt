# Since the game description does not explicitly mention simultaneous moves or hidden information after the initial setup, 
# we infer the imperfect information based on the sequential structure of the game.

# In this game, all moves are sequential and there is no simultaneous move or hidden information after the initial setup. 
# Each player's move is fully informed by the previous actions, making it a game of perfect information at each decision point.

# Therefore, there is no need to group any nodes into the same information set based on the given game description. 
# Each decision is made with full knowledge of the previous actions, and there are no simultaneous moves that would require 
# the use of information sets to represent imperfect information.

# No code for set_infoset is necessary based on the provided game description.
