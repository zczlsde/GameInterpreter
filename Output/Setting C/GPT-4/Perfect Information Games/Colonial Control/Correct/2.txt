```python
# Since Country B moves first with a choice between "Accept" and "Rebel", there's no need for an information set for Country B's initial move.
# However, after Country B decides to "Rebel", Country A's decision to "Grant Independence" or "Suppress" leads to a chance node for the war outcome.
# The outcomes of the war (Country B winning or losing) are chance events that Country A cannot control or observe before making a decision.
# Therefore, Country A's decision nodes after "Suppress" are not directly linked to imperfect information between these nodes, but to the uncertainty of war outcome.
# The imperfect information in this game is not about Country A or Country B not knowing the other's moves, but about the uncertainty of the war outcome, which is modeled as a chance move.
# Hence, there's no explicit need to group decision nodes into information sets based on the players' decisions as the game's structure and sequence of moves provide clear information at each decision node.
# The only potential for imperfect information grouping would be if we considered the war outcomes as decision nodes for Country A, which they are not; they are outcomes of a chance move.
# Therefore, this game does not require the use of set_infoset() to group nodes based on the provided game structure and the nature of decisions and outcomes.

```python

g.append_move(g.root, "Country B", ["Accept", "Rebel"])

# If Country B accepts, Country A decides whether to "Tax" or "Drop Taxes"
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Country A", ["Tax", "Drop Taxes"])
# Set outcomes for Country A's decision after Country B accepts
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([6, -2], label="Tax"))

# If Country B rebels, Country A decides to either "Grant Independence" or "Suppress"
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Country A", ["Grant Independence", "Suppress"])
# Set outcome for granting independence
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 3], label="Grant Independence"))

# If Country A decides to suppress, it leads to a chance node for the war outcome

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the scenario between Country A and Country B using the pygambit library. The game starts with Country B's decision to either accept the status quo or rebel. Depending on Country B's choice, Country A makes subsequent decisions that lead to different outcomes, including a chance move representing the uncertain outcome of a war if Country B rebels and Country A chooses to suppress the rebellion. The probabilities of winning or losing the war for Country B are represented using `gbt.Rational` to accurately reflect the chances in fractional form.
