# Since all decisions by Country A are made with full information of Country B's actions, there's no need for information sets for Country A's decisions.
# Country B does not make decisions after the initial move, so there's no need to set information sets for Country B either.

# Note: The game structure implies that Country A's decisions are fully informed by Country B's actions, and there are no simultaneous moves requiring information sets to group indistinguishable decision nodes for either player.

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the scenario between Country A and Country B using the pygambit library. The game starts with Country B's decision to either accept the status quo or rebel. Depending on Country B's choice, Country A then makes decisions that lead to different outcomes, including a chance node representing the uncertain outcome of a war if Country B rebels and Country A chooses to suppress the rebellion. The probabilities of winning or losing the war are set according to the given scenario, and the payoffs are assigned based on the outcomes of each decision path.
