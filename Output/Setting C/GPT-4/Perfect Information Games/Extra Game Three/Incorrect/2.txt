```python
# Step 1: Since the game starts with a chance node that determines one of four possible outcomes (A, B, C, or D), 
# and Player 1's decision follows the outcome of this chance node, Player 1 does not have imperfect information 
# regarding the outcome of the chance node. Therefore, we do not need to group any of Player 1's decision nodes 
# into the same information set based on the outcome of the chance node.

# Step 2: Player 2's decision comes after Player 1 has chosen an action (E, F, or G). Since Player 2's decision 
# is based on observing Player 1's action, there is no imperfect information for Player 2 regarding Player 1's action. 
# Therefore, we do not need to group any of Player 2's decision nodes into the same information set based on Player 1's actions.

# Conclusion: Given the game's structure as described, there are no instances where a player must make a decision 
# without being able to distinguish between different game states that have occurred previously. This means there 
# are no decision nodes for either player that need to be grouped into the same information set due to imperfect information.

# Since the game as described does not involve imperfect information that requires grouping decision nodes into the same information set,
# no set_infoset() functions are necessary for this game's representation.

This code snippet creates an extensive-form game with a chance node leading to different outcomes (A, B, C, D), followed by decisions from Player 1 and Player 2. The payoffs are set according to the game description. Note that the code for handling imperfect information (`set_infoset()`) is not used here, as the game structure provided does not involve any imperfect information scenarios that require grouping decision nodes into the same information set.
