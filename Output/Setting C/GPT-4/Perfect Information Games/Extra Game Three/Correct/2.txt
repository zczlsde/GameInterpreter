# Step 1: Since Player 1's decision comes after observing the result of a chance node but before Player 2's decision, 
# and Player 2's decision comes after observing Player 1's action, we have a sequential game with imperfect information.

# Step 2: Player 1 does not know the outcome of the chance node directly but chooses actions based on the outcome. 
# However, this step is about setting information sets, and Player 1's decision is directly after the chance node, 
# so there's no need to group Player 1's decisions in information sets based on the description.

# Step 3: Player 2's decision comes after Player 1's choice. Since Player 2 observes Player 1's action, 
# each of Player 2's decision nodes will be uniquely determined by Player 1's previous action. 
# Therefore, there's no need to group Player 2's decisions in information sets based on Player 1's actions, 
# as each of Player 2's decision nodes will be distinct and based on the known action of Player 1.

# Conclusion: Given the game's structure as described, there's no need to group decision nodes into the same information set 
# based on the players not knowing which node they are at. Player 2's decisions are fully informed by Player 1's actions, 
# and Player 1's decisions are directly following the chance node, with no further decisions that would require grouping into information sets.

# Therefore, no set_infoset() function calls are necessary for this game structure based on the provided description.

g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["A", "B", "C", "D"])
# Set the probabilities for each outcome of the chance node equally
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.infoset, [gbt.Rational(1, 4)] * 4)
