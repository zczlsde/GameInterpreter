```python
# Since the game description does not explicitly involve a chance move or simultaneous moves,
# and the moves are sequential (Firm 2 decides to enter or not, then Firm 1 reacts),
# there's no need to group decision nodes into the same information set based on the given description.
# Each player's decision is made with perfect information about the previous actions.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this game structure.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Firm 1 and Firm 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Firm 1", "Firm 2"], title="Market Entry Game")

# Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out
g.append_move(g.root, "Firm 2", ["Enter", "Stay Out"])

# If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 must decide whether to fight or accommodate
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Firm 1", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])

# Define payoffs based on the game description
# Payoffs when Firm 2 stays out
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], g.add_outcome([2, 0], label="Firm 2 Stays Out"))

# Payoffs when Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 fights
# It's mentioned that Firm 2 earns more than Firm 1 if Firm 1 fights, but exact values are not given.
# Assuming specific values for demonstration: Firm 1 earns 0, Firm 2 earns 3
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 3], label="Fight"))

# Payoffs when Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 accommodates
# Both firms earn an equal amount, assuming specific values for demonstration: both earn 1
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, 1], label="Accommodate"))

# Save the EFG

This code snippet creates an extensive-form game representing the strategic interaction between an established monopolist (Firm 1) and a potential entrant (Firm 2). The game is sequential, starting with Firm 2's decision to enter the market or stay out. If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 chooses how to react, either by fighting to maintain its monopoly or by accommodating the entrant to share the market. The payoffs reflect the outcomes of these strategic choices.
