```python
# Step 1: Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out. This is a decision node for Firm 2.
# Step 2: If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 decides to Fight or Accommodate. This is a decision node for Firm 1.
# Since Firm 2's decision is known to Firm 1 when Firm 1 is making their decision, there is no imperfect information between these steps.
# Therefore, there is no need to group any nodes into the same information set based on the game description provided.
# The game described does not involve simultaneous moves or hidden information after the initial move, thus no set_infoset() function is required.
```

Given the game description, we can construct the extensive-form game using the PyGambit library. The game involves two players (Firm 1 and Firm 2) with sequential moves and no simultaneous moves or hidden information. Therefore, we don't need to use `g.set_infoset()` for handling imperfect information. Here's how you can code this game:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with two players: Firm 1 and Firm 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Firm 1", "Firm 2"], title="Market Entry Game")

# Step 1: Firm 2 decides whether to Enter the market or Stay Out
# This creates a decision node for Firm 2 with two actions: "Enter" and "Stay Out"
g.append_move(g.root, "Firm 2", ["Enter", "Stay Out"])

# If Firm 2 stays out, the game ends. We need to set the payoffs for this outcome.
# Assuming Firm 1 earns more if Firm 2 stays out, let's say the payoffs are (2, 0) where Firm 1 gets 2 and Firm 2 gets 0.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], g.add_outcome([2, 0], label="Stay Out"))

# Step 2: If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 must decide to Fight or Accommodate
# This creates a decision node for Firm 1 with two actions: "Fight" and "Accommodate"
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Firm 1", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])

# If Firm 1 fights, let's assume Firm 2 earns more than Firm 1. For example, payoffs are (1, 3)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([1, 3], label="Fight"))

# If Firm 1 accommodates, both firms earn an equal amount. Let's say the payoffs are (2, 2)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([2, 2], label="Accommodate"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code snippet accurately represents the game described. Firm 2 makes the first move by deciding whether to enter the market or stay out. If Firm 2 enters, then Firm 1 chooses to either fight or accommodate. The payoffs are set according to the outcomes described, with specific values chosen for illustration.
