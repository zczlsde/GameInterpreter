```python
# Since the game described involves a sequential structure with perfect information at each step (each player knows the state of the game when making a decision), 
# there's no need to group nodes into information sets based on the traditional sense of imperfect information (where a player cannot distinguish between different game states).
# However, for the sake of the task, let's consider the hypothetical scenario where there might be imperfect information to illustrate how it would be represented.

# In this game, there's no explicit mention of imperfect information as each player's move is fully observable by the other player before making their own move.
# Therefore, under normal circumstances, we wouldn't group any nodes into the same information set due to the lack of imperfect information.

# However, if we were to artificially introduce a scenario of imperfect information, such as if Alice couldn't see the number of stones removed by Bob in the previous turn (or vice versa),
# we would then group nodes where Alice (or Bob) has to make a decision without knowing the previous move by Bob (or Alice). 
# Since the game description does not provide such a scenario, we do not have a basis to group nodes into the same information set based on the provided rules.

# Conclusion: Given the sequential and fully observable nature of the game as described, there's no need to use set_infoset() to group nodes into information sets for representing imperfect information.
```

To construct the extensive-form game for the scenario described using the PyGambit library, we'll follow the game's sequential structure. Since the game is perfectly observable and each player's move is fully known to the opponent, there's no need for information sets to represent imperfect information. However, we'll structure the game tree to reflect the choices and outcomes as described.

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game tree with two players: Alice and Bob
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alice", "Bob"], title="Avoid the Last Stone")

# Alice starts with the choice to remove one or two stones
alice_start = g.append_move(g.root, "Alice", ["Remove 1", "Remove 2"])

# If Alice removes one stone, Bob can remove one or two stones
bob_after_alice_1 = g.append_move(alice_start.children[0], "Bob", ["Remove 1", "Remove 2"])

# If Bob removes one stone, Alice can again choose to remove one or two stones
alice_after_bob_1 = g.append_move(bob_after_alice_1.children[0], "Alice", ["Remove 1", "Remove 2"])

# If Alice removes one stone, Bob has the choice to remove one or two stones
bob_after_alice_2 = g.append_move(alice_after_bob_1.children[0], "Bob", ["Remove 1", "Remove 2"])

# Outcomes based on the moves
g.set_outcome(bob_after_alice_2.children[0], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Alice loses"))
g.set_outcome(bob_after_alice_2.children[1], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Bob loses"))
g.set_outcome(alice_after_bob_1.children[1], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Bob loses"))

# Continuing the tree for other branches
g.set_outcome(bob_after_alice_1.children[1], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Bob loses"))

# If Alice removes two stones initially
bob_after_alice_2 = g.append_move(alice_start.children[1], "Bob", ["Remove 1", "Remove 2"])

# Similar outcomes based on the moves
g.set_outcome(bob_after_alice_2.children[0], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Bob loses"))
g.set_outcome(bob_after_alice_2.children[1], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Alice loses"))

# Since the game described involves a sequential structure with perfect information at each step,
# there's no need to group nodes into information sets based on the traditional sense of imperfect information.
# However, for the sake of completeness, let's include the hypothetical scenario where there might be imperfect information.
# Given the sequential and fully observable nature of the game as described, there's no need to use set_infoset() to group nodes into information sets for representing imperfect information.

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code constructs the game tree for the described game, detailing each player's choices and the resulting outcomes. The game is structured to reflect the sequential decisions and their consequences, with payoffs assigned based on whether a player wins or loses by avoiding or taking the last stone.
