# Stage 1: Chance node determines L or R with equal probabilities.
# Stage 2: Player 1 observes the outcome of stage 1 (L or R) and chooses either l or r.
# Stage 3: Player 1 chooses again either A or B but has forgotten the outcome of stage 1.

# In stage 3, Player 1's decision nodes after choosing 'l' in stage 2 are grouped in the same information set 
# because she forgets whether it was L or R from stage 1.
# Similarly, Player 1's decision nodes after choosing 'r' in stage 2 are grouped in another information set.

# Assuming g.root.children[0] is the node after L is chosen and g.root.children[1] after R.
# g.root.children[0].children[0] and g.root.children[1].children[0] are nodes after Player 1 chooses 'l'.
# g.root.children[0].children[1] and g.root.children[1].children[1] are nodes after Player 1 chooses 'r'.

# Grouping nodes after 'l' is chosen in stage 2 into the same information set.
