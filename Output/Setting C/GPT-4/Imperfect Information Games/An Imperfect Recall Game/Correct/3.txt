# Stage 1: Chance node determines L or R with equal probabilities.
# Stage 2: Player 1 observes the outcome of stage 1 (L or R) and chooses either l or r.
# Since Player 1 observes the outcome, there's no need for an information set here.
# Stage 3: Player 1 chooses again either A or B but has forgotten the outcome of stage 1.
# She only remembers her choice in stage 2, not whether it was following L or R.
# Therefore, her decisions in stage 3 based on choosing l or r in stage 2 need to be grouped into information sets.
# There will be two information sets in stage 3:
# 1. One for the choices following her initial choice of l (regardless of L or R in stage 1).
# 2. One for the choices following her initial choice of r (regardless of L or R in stage 1).

# Assuming the game tree is constructed with nodes for each stage and choice,
# and assuming the nodes are named sequentially as they are created,
# the nodes for Player 1's decisions in stage 3 following l would be something like:
# g.root.children[0].children[0] (L then l), g.root.children[1].children[0] (R then l)
# And for decisions following r:
# g.root.children[0].children[1] (L then r), g.root.children[1].children[1] (R then r)

# Grouping stage 3 decisions into information sets based on stage 2 decisions:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset) # Grouping choices following l
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset) # Grouping choices following r
