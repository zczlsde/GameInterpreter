# Stage 1: Chance node determines L or R, but this does not directly involve information sets as it's a chance move.
# Stage 2: Player 1 observes L or R and chooses l or r. This stage does not involve imperfect information yet, as Player 1 knows the outcome of the chance node.
# Stage 3: Player 1 chooses A or B without remembering the outcome of stage 1, but knows her choice in stage 2. This introduces imperfect information.
# Since Player 1 forgets whether the initial chance node resulted in L or R, but remembers her choice in stage 2, we need to group the decision nodes in stage 3 based on the action taken in stage 2, not on the outcome of the chance node.

# Assuming the game tree is constructed with the chance node at the root, followed by Player 1's decisions, the nodes for stage 3 can be represented as follows:
# For choice l in stage 2, the nodes for choosing A or B are g.root.children[0].children[0] (for L then l) and g.root.children[1].children[0] (for R then l).
# For choice r in stage 2, the nodes for choosing A or B are g.root.children[0].children[1] (for L then r) and g.root.children[1].children[1] (for R then r).

# Grouping stage 3 nodes based on stage 2 choices:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset) # Group nodes for choice l in stage 2
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset) # Group nodes for choice r in stage 2

# Create a new game with one player (Player 1)

# Stage 1: Chance node determines L or R with equal probabilities
g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["L", "R"])
# Set the probabilities for L and R to 1/2 each
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.infoset, [gbt.Rational(1, 2), gbt.Rational(1, 2)])

# Stage 2: Player 1 observes the outcome of stage 1 and chooses either l or r
# Append moves for Player 1 after L and R
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Player 1", ["l", "r"])

# Stage 3: Player 1 chooses again either A or B without remembering the outcome of stage 1
# Append moves for Player 1's choices in stage 3, based on their stage 2 choice
# For outcome L then choice l or r
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[0], "Player 1", ["A", "B"])

# Group nodes based on Player 1's choice in stage 2, not on the outcome of the chance node
# This is because Player 1 forgets the outcome of stage 1 but remembers her choice in stage 2
