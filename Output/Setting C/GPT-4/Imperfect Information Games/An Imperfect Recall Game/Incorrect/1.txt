```python
# Step 1: Since Player 1 forgets the outcome of the first stage (L or R) by the third stage, 
# but remembers her decision from the second stage (l or r), we need to group the third stage decisions based on the second stage decision.
# There are four possible paths based on the initial chance event and Player 1's second stage decision:
# L -> l, L -> r, R -> l, R -> r.
# In the third stage, Player 1's decision between "A" and "B" should be grouped by her second stage decision, not by the initial chance event outcome.
# This means we have two information sets in the third stage: one for paths that went through "l" and another for paths that went through "r".

# Assuming g is the game object and the structure has been defined up to the third stage:
# Let's say g.root.children[0] is the node after L is chosen and g.root.children[1] is the node after R is chosen.
# g.root.children[0].children[0] and g.root.children[1].children[0] are the nodes after Player 1 chooses "l" in either case.
# g.root.children[0].children[1] and g.root.children[1].children[1] are the nodes after Player 1 chooses "r" in either case.
# Now, for the third stage, we group the nodes based on the second stage decision of Player 1.

# Grouping nodes for the decision "l":
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[0].children[1].infoset)

# Grouping nodes for the decision "r":
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].infoset)
```

# Step 1: Initialize the game with two players (Player 1 and a chance player)
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1"], title="Three-stage game with imperfect recall")

        for great_grandchild in grandchild.children:

This code snippet creates an extensive-form game representation using the pygambit library, following the game description provided. It carefully constructs the game tree, including the chance node at the beginning, Player 1's decisions based on the outcome of the chance event, and Player 1's decisions in the third stage with imperfect recall. The use of `g.set_infoset()` ensures that the third-stage decisions are grouped correctly based on Player 1's second-stage decision, reflecting the imperfect recall aspect of the game.
