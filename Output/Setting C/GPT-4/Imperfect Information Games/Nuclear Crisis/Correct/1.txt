# Step 1: Country A decides to either escalate (E) or ignore (I). This is a decision node for Country A.
# Step 2: If Country A escalates, Country B decides to either back down (B) or escalate further (E).
# Step 3: If both escalate, Country A decides between retreating (R) and detonating (D).
# Step 4: Country B, unaware of Country A's decision, also decides between retreating (R) and detonating (D).
# Since Country B makes a decision without knowing Country A's previous decision (between R and D), these nodes belong to the same information set for Country B.

# Assuming the sequential structure of the game has been defined up to the point where Country A and Country B make their final decisions (R or D) after both have escalated,
# and assuming the nodes for Country B's decisions are represented as g.root.children[...].children[...].children[...] in the game tree,
# the following code groups Country B's decision nodes into the same information set, reflecting Country B's imperfect information about Country A's decision.

# Grouping Country B's decision nodes after Country A chooses to detonate or retreat into the same information set.
