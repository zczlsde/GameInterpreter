```python
# Step 1: Country A decides to either escalate (E) or ignore (I). This is a decision node for Country A.
# Step 2: If Country A escalates, Country B decides to either back down (B) or escalate further (E). This is a decision node for Country B.
# Step 3: If both escalate, Country A decides between retreating (R) and detonating (D). This is a decision node for Country A.
# Step 4: Country B, unaware of Country A's decision between R and D, also decides between retreating (R) and detonating (D). This is a decision node for Country B.
# Since Country B does not know whether Country A has chosen to retreat or detonate, the decision nodes for Country B (retreat or detonate) must be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming the game tree has been constructed up to the point where Country A and Country B are making their decisions after both have chosen to escalate, the code to set the information set for Country B's decision would look like this:

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].infoset)
# This line groups the decision nodes for Country B (retreat or detonate) into the same information set, reflecting that Country B does not know Country A's prior action in this stage of the game.

g.append_move(g.root, "Country A", ["E", "I"])

# If Country A ignores, the game ends with both countries receiving a small positive payoff
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], g.add_outcome([1, 1], label="Ignore"))

# Step 3: If both escalate, Country A decides between retreating (R) and detonating (D)
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "Country A", ["R", "D"])

# Step 4: Country B, unaware of Country A's decision, also decides between retreating (R) and detonating (D)
