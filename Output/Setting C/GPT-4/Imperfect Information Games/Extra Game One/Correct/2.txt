# Step 1: Player 1's decision among A, B, or C does not involve imperfect information.
# Step 2: Player 2's decision after Player 1 chooses A is clear, but when Player 1 chooses B or C, Player 2 cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.
# Therefore, the nodes following B and C for Player 2 should be in the same information set.
# Step 3: After Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1's decision between G and H does not involve imperfect information because it's a direct response to Player 2's action.
# Step 4: Player 2's final decision between Q and W also does not involve imperfect information as it directly follows Player 1's choice of G.

# Assuming the game tree is built up to the point where Player 2 has to make a decision after Player 1's actions B or C,
# and assuming the nodes are structured in a way that reflects the sequential nature of the game,
# we need to group the nodes following Player 1's actions B and C into the same information set for Player 2.
