# Step 1: Player 1's decision at the first stage does not involve imperfect information as it is the first move.
# Step 2: Player 2's decision after Player 1 chooses A is perfectly informed. However, Player 2 cannot distinguish between B and C.
# Therefore, the nodes following B and C for Player 2 should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1], g.root.children[2].infoset)  # Grouping B and C for Player 2's decision

# Step 3: After Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1's decision does not involve imperfect information as Player 1 knows the history.
# No action needed for information sets here.

# Step 4: If Player 2 chooses F, the game ends, so there's no decision to be made afterward.
# No action needed for information sets here.

# Step 5: After Player 1 chooses G, Player 2's decision between Q and W does not involve imperfect information.
# No action needed for information sets here.

# Note: The game structure implies that after Player 1's initial choice, only Player 2 faces a situation of imperfect information (between B and C).
# This is the only point in the game where an information set grouping is necessary based on the given description.
