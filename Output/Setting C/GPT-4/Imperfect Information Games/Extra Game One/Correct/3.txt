```python
# Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between actions B and C taken by Player 1, we need to group the decision nodes following B and C in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1], g.root.children[2].infoset)

# Note: The game description does not specify any other points of imperfect information that would require grouping of nodes into the same information set. 
# The initial move by Player 1 (A, B, or C) is perfectly informed to Player 2 only if A is chosen. 
# The subsequent moves (D, E, F by Player 2 and G, H by Player 1) do not involve imperfect information as described, except for the inability of Player 2 to distinguish between B and C.
# Therefore, no further set_infoset() calls are necessary based on the given game description.
