# Step 1: Player 1's decision at the first stage does not involve imperfect information as it's the game's initial move.
# Step 2: Player 2's decision after Player 1 chooses A is perfectly informed. However, when Player 1 chooses B or C, Player 2 faces imperfect information as they cannot distinguish between these actions.
# Step 3: To represent this, we group the decision nodes following Player 1's actions B and C into the same information set for Player 2.
# Step 4: Player 1's decision in the third stage (after Player 2 chooses D or E) does not involve new imperfect information settings that need to be grouped because Player 1 is perfectly informed of the game history.

# Assuming the game tree has been constructed up to the point where Player 2 makes their decision after Player 1's actions B or C:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[0].infoset) # Grouping nodes after B and C for Player 2's decision
# Note: This assumes that g.root.children[1] corresponds to Player 1 choosing B and g.root.children[2] corresponds to Player 1 choosing C.
# The children[0] of these nodes represent the starting point of Player 2's decision nodes which cannot be distinguished by Player 2.
