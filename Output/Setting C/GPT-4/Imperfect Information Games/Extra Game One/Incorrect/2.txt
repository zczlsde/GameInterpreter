```python
# Step 1: Player 1's decision at the first stage does not involve imperfect information as it's the first move.
# Step 2: Player 2's decision after Player 1 chooses A is perfectly informed. However, if Player 1 chooses B or C, Player 2 cannot distinguish between these actions.
# Therefore, the nodes following actions B and C for Player 1 are in the same information set for Player 2.
# Step 3: After Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1's decision to choose G or H does not involve new information sets as Player 2's choice is known to Player 1.
# Step 4: If Player 1 chooses G, then Player 2's decision between Q and W does not involve imperfect information as the history of actions is fully known.

# Assuming the game tree has been constructed up to the point where Player 2 makes their decision after Player 1's actions B or C:
g.set_infoset("node_after_B", "node_after_C".infoset)  # Grouping nodes after Player 1's actions B and C into the same information set for Player 2

This code outlines the structure for creating an extensive-form game with imperfect information using the pygambit library. The specific handling of imperfect information (the `g.set_infoset()` line) is illustrated but not directly executable as written; it requires identifying the specific nodes after B and C and then grouping them into the same information set for Player 2. This step is crucial for accurately representing the game's structure where Player 2 cannot distinguish between actions B and C taken by Player 1.
