```python
# Since Player 2's decision depends on Player 1's action but with a chance of misinterpretation, 
# we need to represent this uncertainty in the information set of Player 2.

# Player 1's decision nodes are straightforward as they choose between "S" and "C" without any uncertainty.
# These choices lead to different branches in the game tree, each corresponding to Player 1's actual choice.

# For Player 2, the decision nodes depend on what they perceive Player 1's choice to be. 
# Due to the chance of misinterpretation, Player 2's perception could be incorrect. 
# This means that for each of Player 1's actions, there are two possible perceptions for Player 2, 
# one where the action is correctly interpreted and one where it is not.

# Therefore, we need to group the decision nodes of Player 2 into information sets that reflect this uncertainty.
# Each information set for Player 2 will contain nodes that correspond to the same perceived action by Player 1, 
# regardless of whether this perception is correct or not.

# Assuming the game tree is constructed in a way that after Player 1's decision, 
# there are nodes representing the chance of misinterpretation leading to Player 2's perception,
# and then Player 2 makes a decision based on this perception.

# Let's denote the nodes where Player 2 perceives Player 1's action as "S" (correctly or incorrectly) as nodeS1, nodeS2, 
# and the nodes where Player 2 perceives Player 1's action as "C" (correctly or incorrectly) as nodeC1, nodeC2.

# We group these nodes into two information sets, one for each perceived action by Player 2.

g.set_infoset(nodeS1, nodeS2.infoset) # Grouping nodes where Player 2 perceives "S"
g.set_infoset(nodeC1, nodeC2.infoset) # Grouping nodes where Player 2 perceives "C"

# This setup ensures that within each information set, Player 2 knows they are at one of the nodes in the set 
# (indicating their perception of Player 1's action) but cannot distinguish which one exactly, 
# reflecting the imperfect information due to the chance of misinterpretation.
