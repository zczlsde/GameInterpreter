```python
# Since Player 2's decision depends on Player 1's choice but with a chance of misinterpretation,
# we need to represent this uncertainty in the information sets.
# Player 1 has two actions, S and C. Player 2's perception is influenced by a chance node,
# which represents the probability of misinterpreting Player 1's action.
# For simplicity, let's assume the game tree is already constructed with these chance nodes.

# After Player 1 chooses an action, there are chance nodes for misinterpretation.
# Let's say g.root.children[0] is the node where Player 1 chooses S,
# and g.root.children[1] is where Player 1 chooses C.
# Each of these nodes will have two children: one where Player 2 correctly interprets the action,
# and one where Player 2 misinterprets it.

# For Player 2, the decision nodes after Player 1 chooses S (correctly interpreted and misinterpreted)
# should be in the same information set because Player 2 cannot distinguish between these scenarios.
# Similarly, the decision nodes after Player 1 chooses C (correctly interpreted and misinterpreted)
# should be in another information set for the same reason.

# Assuming g.root.children[0].children[0] is the node where Player 1 chooses S and is correctly interpreted by Player 2,
# and g.root.children[0].children[1] is where Player 1 chooses S but is misinterpreted by Player 2,
# these nodes should be in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)

# Assuming g.root.children[1].children[0] is the node where Player 1 chooses C and is correctly interpreted by Player 2,
# and g.root.children[1].children[1] is where Player 1 chooses C but is misinterpreted by Player 2,
# these nodes should be in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)

# This setup ensures that Player 2's decisions are grouped into information sets that reflect the imperfect information
# regarding Player 1's actual choices due to the possibility of misinterpretation.
