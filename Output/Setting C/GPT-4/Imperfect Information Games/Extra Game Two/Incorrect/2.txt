```python
# Since Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, Player 2's decision nodes are in the same information set.
# Player 1's decision in the third stage also does not depend on knowing Player 2's choice directly but is based on their own initial choice.
# However, since the game description does not specify that Player 1 forgets their first move, we assume Player 1 remembers their choice.
# Therefore, there's no need to group Player 1's third-stage decisions based on Player 2's actions, as they are inherently linked to Player 1's initial choice.
# Player 3's decision does not depend on previous actions in a way that would require an information set grouping, as their decision is the final action.

# However, to accurately represent the game as described, we would typically need to create the game tree and then identify where information sets are required.
# The description provided does not necessitate grouping nodes into information sets for Player 2 or Player 3 based on the information given.
# This is because Player 2's decision is made without knowledge of Player 1's action, but this is a single decision point, not multiple nodes requiring grouping.
# Similarly, Player 3's decision is the final action and does not involve uncertainty about the game state from their perspective that would require an information set.

# Given the structure of the game, there are no explicit instructions to group multiple decision nodes for any player under the same information set based on the provided description.
# All players' decisions are made sequentially with the given information at their time of decision, and there's no indication that any player's decision is made simultaneously or with uncertainty about which node they are at, except for the inherent uncertainty in Player 2's and Player 3's decisions due to not observing Player 1's choices.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function calls are necessary based on the game description provided.
