# Since Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, Player 2's decision nodes must be grouped in the same information set.
# This implies that after Player 1 chooses A, B, or C, Player 2's decision between D and E cannot distinguish between A, B, or C.
# Therefore, all of Player 2's decision nodes following Player 1's choices of A, B, or C are in the same information set.

# Similarly, Player 1's decision in the third stage (choosing between F and G) cannot distinguish between Player 2's earlier choices (D or E),

To construct the extensive-form game (EFG) for the described scenario using the pygambit library, we'll follow the game's structure step by step. The game involves three players, with sequential moves and a point where Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, indicating imperfect information. Player 1's third-stage decision also reflects imperfect information as it does not depend on Player 2's second-stage choice. Here's how we can code this:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with three players
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2", "Player 3"],
                      title="Sequential game with imperfect information")

# First stage: Player 1 chooses among A, B, and C
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["A", "B", "C"])

# Second stage: Player 2 chooses between D and E without knowing Player 1's choice
# This is where we introduce imperfect information for Player 2's decision
for choice in ["A", "B", "C"]:
    for node in g.root.children:
        g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["D", "E"])

# Third stage: Player 1 chooses between F and G, also under imperfect information
for choice1 in ["A", "B", "C"]:
    for choice2 in ["D", "E"]:
        for node in g.root.children:
            for child in node.children:
                g.append_move(child, "Player 1", ["F", "G"])

# Fourth stage: Player 3 decides between Q and W
for choice1 in ["A", "B", "C"]:
    for choice2 in ["D", "E"]:
        for choice3 in ["F", "G"]:
            for node in g.root.children:
                for child in node.children:
                    for grandchild in child.children:
                        g.append_move(grandchild, "Player 3", ["Q", "W"])

# Set outcomes based on Player 3's decision
for choice1 in ["A", "B", "C"]:
    for choice2 in ["D", "E"]:
        for choice3 in ["F", "G"]:
            for node in g.root.children:
                for child in node.children:
                    for grandchild in child.children:
                        for great_grandchild in grandchild.children:
                            if great_grandchild.move.label == "Q":
                                g.set_outcome(great_grandchild, g.add_outcome([3, 3, 3]))
                            else:  # Player 3 chooses W
                                g.set_outcome(great_grandchild, g.add_outcome([2, 2, 3]))

# Handling imperfect information for Player 2's decision
# Since Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, Player 2's decision nodes must be grouped in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decisions after Player 1 chooses A
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decisions after Player 1 chooses B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decisions after Player 1 chooses C

# Handling imperfect information for Player 1's third-stage decision
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[0].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 1's decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of A
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 1's decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of A
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 1's decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 1's decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[0].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 1's decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of C
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[1].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[1].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 1's decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of C

# Note: The actual game tree construction requires appending moves and setting outcomes before setting information sets.
# The provided code for setting information sets assumes that the game tree structure (nodes and moves) is already correctly built.
```

This code outlines the structure of the game, including the decisions at each stage and the handling of imperfect information. Note that the actual implementation of `set_infoset` should follow the creation of moves and outcomes, ensuring that the game's structure is correctly represented.
