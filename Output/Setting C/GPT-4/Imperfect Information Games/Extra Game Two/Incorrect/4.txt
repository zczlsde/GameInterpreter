```python
# Since Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, Player 2's decision nodes must be grouped in the same information set.
# This implies that after Player 1 chooses A, B, or C, the decision nodes for Player 2 after each of these choices are indistinguishable to Player 2.
# Therefore, we group these nodes into the same information set for Player 2.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses A
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses C

# Similarly, Player 1's decision in the third stage (choosing between F and G) is also made without knowing Player 2's choice in the second stage.
# However, since this decision is made in a new stage after Player 2's move, and Player 1's decision could potentially depend on their own initial choice (A, B, or C), 
# we need to ensure that the information sets correctly reflect this.
# In this case, the information sets for Player 1's third-stage decisions are inherently separated by the structure of the game (since Player 1's third-stage decisions follow Player 2's decision).
# Therefore, no additional set_infoset() calls are needed for Player 1's third-stage decisions.

# For Player 3, there is no need to group decision nodes into information sets based on the game description provided, as Player 3's decision is the final action in the game sequence.
# Thus, no additional set_infoset() calls are needed for Player 3.
```

To construct the extensive-form game described using the PyGambit library, we'll follow the game's stages and player decisions step by step. The game involves three players, with sequential moves and a point where one player makes a decision without knowing the previous player's choice, indicating imperfect information.

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with three players
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2", "Player 3"],
                      title="Sequential game with imperfect information")

# First stage: Player 1 chooses among A, B, and C
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["A", "B", "C"])

# Second stage: Player 2 chooses between D and E without knowing Player 1's choice
# This creates three branches from each of Player 1's decisions
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["D", "E"])

# Since Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice,
# Player 2's decision nodes must be grouped in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses A
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[1].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses C

# Third stage: Player 1 chooses between F and G after Player 2's decision
# This creates two branches from each of Player 2's decisions
for first_level_node in g.root.children:
    for second_level_node in first_level_node.children:
        g.append_move(second_level_node, "Player 1", ["F", "G"])

# Fourth stage: Player 3 decides between Q and W, finalizing the game
for first_level_node in g.root.children:
    for second_level_node in first_level_node.children:
        for third_level_node in second_level_node.children:
            g.append_move(third_level_node, "Player 3", ["Q", "W"])

# Setting outcomes based on Player 3's decision
# If Player 3 selects Q, all players receive a payoff of 3
# If Player 3 selects W, Player 1 and Player 2 each receive a payoff of 2, while Player 3 gets 3
for first_level_node in g.root.children:
    for second_level_node in first_level_node.children:
        for third_level_node in second_level_node.children:
            g.set_outcome(third_level_node.children[0], g.add_outcome([3, 3, 3], label="All choose Q"))
            g.set_outcome(third_level_node.children[1], g.add_outcome([2, 2, 3], label="P1 and P2 choose W, P3 gets 3"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code constructs the extensive-form game as described, with sequential moves and imperfect information handled according to the instructions. The use of `g.set_infoset()` ensures that Player 2's decisions are grouped correctly to reflect their lack of information about Player 1's choice.
