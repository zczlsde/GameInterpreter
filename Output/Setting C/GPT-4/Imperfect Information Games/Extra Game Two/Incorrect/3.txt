```python
# Step 1: Player 1's decision at the first stage does not involve imperfect information as it's the first move.
# Step 2: Player 2's decision is made without knowing Player 1's choice, which introduces imperfect information.
# Since Player 2's decision is based on not knowing Player 1's initial choice, all of Player 2's decision nodes after each of Player 1's actions (A, B, C) are in the same information set.
# However, since the pygambit API requires explicit node references and the game tree structure is not fully described, we assume the following structure for demonstration:
# Player 1's actions lead to three separate branches (for A, B, C). Each branch leads to Player 2's decision nodes (for D, E), which should be in the same information set.
# Step 3: Player 1's decision in the third stage again involves imperfect information because it's a continuation of their initial choice without new information from Player 2.
# However, this step's information set grouping depends on the previous choices, and without explicit node paths, we assume Player 1's decisions after Player 2's are grouped by their initial choice.
# Step 4: Player 3's decision does not involve imperfect information from their perspective as they make the final move, but this step is not relevant to setting information sets for imperfect information earlier in the game.

# Assuming nodes are structured sequentially for simplicity, the actual implementation would require specific node references based on the game tree structure.
# For example, if Player 2's decisions after Player 1 chooses A are represented by nodes g.root.children[0].children[0] (for D) and g.root.children[0].children[1] (for E),
# and similarly for B and C, then the information sets would be set as follows:

# Note: The actual node references (e.g., g.root.children[0].children[0]) are placeholders and should be replaced with the correct references based on the game's tree structure.

# g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decisions after A and B into the same infoset
# g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset) # Grouping Player 2's decisions after C into the same infoset as after A and B

# This code block assumes a specific tree structure and the actual implementation would need to adjust the node references based on the actual game tree created with pygambit.
```

To construct the extensive-form game described using the pygambit library, we'll follow the game's stages and player decisions as outlined. The game involves three players making sequential decisions with imperfect information at certain stages. Here's how we can implement it:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with three players
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2", "Player 3"],
                      title="Sequential game with imperfect information")

# Stage 1: Player 1's decision (A, B, C)
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["A", "B", "C"])

# Stage 2: Player 2's decision (D, E) without knowing Player 1's choice
# We create decision nodes for Player 2 after each of Player 1's choices
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["D", "E"])

# Since Player 2's decision is made without knowing Player 1's choice,
# all of Player 2's decision nodes are in the same information set.
# We use the identical code as instructed to handle the imperfect information.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)

# Stage 3: Player 1's decision (F, G) after Player 2's decision
# We assume Player 1's decisions are based on their initial choice and Player 2's response
for child in g.root.children:
    for node in child.children:
        g.append_move(node, "Player 1", ["F", "G"])

# Stage 4: Player 3's final decision (Q, W)
# Player 3's decision follows all previous decisions
for child in g.root.children:
    for node in child.children:
        for subnode in node.children:
            g.append_move(subnode, "Player 3", ["Q", "W"])

# Setting outcomes based on Player 3's decision
# If Player 3 selects Q, all players receive a payoff of 3
# If Player 3 selects W, Player 1 and Player 2 receive a payoff of 2, while Player 3 gets 3
for child in g.root.children:
    for node in child.children:
        for subnode in node.children:
            g.set_outcome(subnode.children[0], g.add_outcome([3, 3, 3], label="All choose Q"))
            g.set_outcome(subnode.children[1], g.add_outcome([2, 2, 3], label="Player 3 chooses W"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code constructs the game tree as described, with Player 1 making the initial decision among actions A, B, and C. Player 2 then makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, introducing imperfect information. Player 1 makes another decision based on the game's progression but without new information from Player 2. Finally, Player 3 makes the last decision, determining the final payoffs based on their action. The use of `g.set_infoset()` ensures that Player 2's decisions are grouped into the same information set, reflecting their lack of information about Player 1's initial choice.
