# Step 1: The game starts with a chance node determining the new manufacturer's strength (S or W).
# Step 2: The new manufacturer sends a signal (S or W), leading to four possible scenarios: SS, SW, WS, WW.
# Step 3: The existing manufacturer observes the signal but does not know the actual strength, leading to imperfect information.
# Step 4: For each signal sent by the new manufacturer, the existing manufacturer must decide to either compete (F) or accommodate (A).
# Step 5: Since the existing manufacturer's decision is based on the signal and not the actual strength, the decision nodes after each signal must be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming the game tree has been constructed up to the point where the existing manufacturer makes a decision,
# and the nodes are ordered as follows: SS_F, SS_A, SW_F, SW_A, WS_F, WS_A, WW_F, WW_A.
# The existing manufacturer cannot distinguish between the actual strength behind a signal, so nodes after SS and SW belong to the same information set,
# as well as nodes after WS and WW.

# Grouping decision nodes after a strong signal (SS and SW) into the same information set.
