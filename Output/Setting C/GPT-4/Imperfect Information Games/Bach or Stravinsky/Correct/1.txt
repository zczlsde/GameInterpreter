# Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously, we model this as if one player moves first and the other second for representation.
# However, the second player (whichever we choose for this role) does not know the action of the first player when making their decision.
# Therefore, all decision nodes of the second player belong to the same information set as they cannot distinguish between the actions taken by the first player.

# Let's assume Alexis moves first in our representation and chooses between Bach and Stravinsky.
# Then, Beverley moves, but since Beverley's decision is simultaneous with Alexis', Beverley cannot know Alexis' choice.
# Thus, Beverley's decision nodes after Alexis chooses Bach and after Alexis chooses Stravinsky should be in the same information set.

# Assuming g.root.children[0] is the node where Alexis chooses Bach and g.root.children[1] is where Alexis chooses Stravinsky,
# and Beverley's decisions follow each of these, we group Beverley's decision nodes into the same information set.
