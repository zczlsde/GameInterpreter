```python
# Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously and independently,
# we model this by assuming one player moves first and the other second for representation,
# but in reality, they don't know each other's choices when making their own decision.

# Let's assume Alexis moves first and chooses between Bach and Stravinsky,
# then Beverley moves, also choosing between Bach and Stravinsky.

# However, since Beverley makes her decision without knowing Alexis's choice,
# both of Beverley's decision nodes (after Alexis chooses Bach and after Alexis chooses Stravinsky)
# should be in the same information set to represent that Beverley cannot distinguish between these scenarios.

# Similarly, if we were to model it with Beverley moving first, then Alexis's decision nodes
# would need to be grouped in the same information set for the same reason.

# Therefore, the necessary set_infoset() function to represent this game correctly is:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with two players: Alexis and Beverley
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alexis", "Beverley"], title="Bach or Stravinsky?")

# Although Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously,
# for modeling purposes, we'll assume Alexis moves first.
# Alexis chooses between Bach and Stravinsky.
g.append_move(g.root, "Alexis", ["Bach", "Stravinsky"])

# For each of Alexis's choices, Beverley then makes her choice,
# also between Bach and Stravinsky.
# We append moves for Beverley under each of Alexis's choices.
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Beverley", ["Bach", "Stravinsky"])

# Now, we set the outcomes based on the game description.
# If both choose Bach, Alexis (Bach lover) gets a higher payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Bach"))
# If both choose Stravinsky, Beverley (Stravinsky lover) gets a higher payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Stravinsky"))
# If they choose different events, they both get no payoffs.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Disagreement on Bach"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Disagreement on Stravinsky"))

# Since Beverley makes her decision without knowing Alexis's choice,
# both of Beverley's decision nodes (after Alexis chooses Bach and after Alexis chooses Stravinsky)
# should be in the same information set to represent that Beverley cannot distinguish between these scenarios.
# This is crucial to model the simultaneous decision-making aspect of the game.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
