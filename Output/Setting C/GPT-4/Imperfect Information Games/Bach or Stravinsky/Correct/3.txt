```python
# Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously and independently,
# we model this by assuming one player moves first and the other second for representation,
# but in reality, they don't know each other's choices when making their own decision.

# Let's assume Alexis moves first and chooses between Bach and Stravinsky,
# then Beverley moves, also choosing between Bach and Stravinsky.

# However, since Beverley makes her decision without knowing Alexis's choice,
# both of Beverley's decision nodes (after Alexis chooses Bach and after Alexis chooses Stravinsky)
# should be in the same information set to represent that Beverley cannot distinguish between these scenarios.

# Similarly, if we were to model it with Beverley moving first, then Alexis's decision nodes
# would need to be grouped in the same information set for the same reason.

# Therefore, the necessary set_infoset() function to represent this game correctly is:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
# This line groups Beverley's decision nodes (assuming Alexis moves first) into the same information set,
# indicating Beverley does not know Alexis's prior action when making her decision.

# Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously and independently,
# we model this by assuming Alexis moves first for representation purposes.
# Alexis chooses between Bach and Stravinsky.
g.append_move(g.root, "Alexis", ["Bach", "Stravinsky"])

# For each of Alexis's choices, Beverley then makes her choice also between Bach and Stravinsky.
# However, since the decisions are made simultaneously, Beverley's choices are in the same information set.

# Set outcomes based on the game description:
# If both choose Bach, Alexis (Bach lover) gets a higher payoff, and Beverley (Stravinsky lover) gets a lower payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Bach"))
# If both choose Stravinsky, Beverley gets a higher payoff, and Alexis gets a lower payoff.
