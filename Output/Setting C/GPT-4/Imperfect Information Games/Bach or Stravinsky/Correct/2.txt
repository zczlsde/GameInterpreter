```python
# Since Alexis and Beverley make their choices simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# To model this game with a sequential structure, we assume Beverley moves first and Alexis moves second.
# However, because their moves are actually simultaneous, Alexis does not know Beverley's choice when making her own decision.
# Therefore, all of Alexis's decision nodes, which follow Beverley's choices, should be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming the game tree has been constructed with Beverley choosing between Bach and Stravinsky first (even though this is just for modeling purposes and not the actual play of the game),
# and then Alexis choosing between Bach and Stravinsky, we would have a structure where Beverley's decision leads to two branches (Bach, Stravinsky),
# and each of those branches leads to two further branches for Alexis's decisions.

# The starting node, g.root, is Beverley's decision node.
# Beverley has two actions, Bach and Stravinsky. So, Alexis's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Beverley's actions Bach and Stravinsky.
# Alexis, moving simultaneously, does not know which action Beverley has taken. 
# Therefore, Alexis's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with two players, Alexis and Beverley
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alexis", "Beverley"], title="Bach or Stravinsky?")

# Although Alexis and Beverley make their choices simultaneously, for modeling purposes in an extensive form game,
# we need to create a sequential structure. We'll model the game as if Beverley moves first and then Alexis,
# but we'll use information sets to represent the simultaneous nature of their decisions.

# Append a move for Beverley at the root of the game tree, with two actions: Bach and Stravinsky.
g.append_move(g.root, "Beverley", ["Bach", "Stravinsky"])

# For each of Beverley's choices, append a move for Alexis, also with two actions: Bach and Stravinsky.
# This creates a branch for each of Alexis's decisions under each of Beverley's decisions.
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Alexis", ["Bach", "Stravinsky"])

# Since Alexis's decisions are actually made simultaneously with Beverley's (they do not know each other's choices),
# all of Alexis's decision nodes following Beverley's choices should be grouped in the same information set.
# This represents the imperfect information in the game.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Now, we set the outcomes based on the game description.
# If both choose Bach, Alexis gets a higher payoff, and Beverley gets a lower payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Bach"))

# If both choose Stravinsky, Beverley gets a higher payoff, and Alexis gets a lower payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Stravinsky"))

# If they choose different concerts, neither player receives any payoff.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Different choices - Bach/Stravinsky"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Different choices - Stravinsky/Bach"))

This code snippet constructs the extensive form game for the "Bach or Stravinsky?" scenario using the pygambit library. It models the simultaneous decision-making process by using information sets to group Alexis's decisions, reflecting the imperfect information inherent in the game. The outcomes are set according to the preferences of Alexis and Beverley for attending either a Bach or Stravinsky concert together.
