```python
# Since Alexis and Beverley make their choices simultaneously, this implies imperfect information.
# However, in this specific game description, there's no sequential structure that requires the use of information sets.
# Both players choose between Bach and Stravinsky without any prior moves that would create different decision nodes for a player.
# Therefore, there's no need to group decision nodes into information sets because each player's decision is made without knowledge of the other's decision, but there are no sequential decisions that would necessitate the use of information sets as described in the examples.
# In essence, the game's structure does not involve sequential moves where a player cannot distinguish between different nodes based on prior actions, which is when information sets are typically used.
# Thus, no code for setting information sets is necessary for this game description.
```

To model the "Bach or Stravinsky?" game using the pygambit library, we'll construct an extensive-form game representation. Given that Alexis and Beverley make their choices simultaneously, we'll introduce a chance move at the beginning to simulate the simultaneous decision-making process. This approach allows us to represent the game in an extensive form while acknowledging the simultaneous nature of the decisions. Here's how we can do it:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with two players: Alexis and Beverley
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alexis", "Beverley"], title="Bach or Stravinsky?")

# Since decisions are made simultaneously, we simulate this with a chance move
# The chance move will have four outcomes, representing the four possible decision combinations
g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["Bach_Bach", "Bach_Stravinsky", "Stravinsky_Bach", "Stravinsky_Stravinsky"])

# Set the probabilities for each outcome of the chance move
# Since it's a simultaneous move game, each outcome has an equal probability
# However, as we're not using probabilities in this setup directly (each path represents a distinct, equally likely outcome),
# we don't need to explicitly set probabilities here. Each path implicitly has equal probability.

# Define the outcomes for each path
# If both choose Bach, Alexis gets a higher payoff, and Beverley gets a lower payoff
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Bach"))

# If Alexis chooses Bach and Beverley chooses Stravinsky, neither gets a payoff
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Alexis Bach, Beverley Stravinsky"))

# If Alexis chooses Stravinsky and Beverley chooses Bach, neither gets a payoff
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[2], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Alexis Stravinsky, Beverley Bach"))

# If both choose Stravinsky, Beverley gets a higher payoff, and Alexis gets a lower payoff
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[3], g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Stravinsky"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

In this code, we've represented the simultaneous decision-making process by introducing a chance move at the beginning with four outcomes, each corresponding to a possible combination of choices by Alexis and Beverley. This approach allows us to model the game in an extensive form while respecting the simultaneous nature of the decisions. Since the game does not involve sequential moves or decisions made based on previous actions, there's no need for information sets to represent imperfect information in this context.
