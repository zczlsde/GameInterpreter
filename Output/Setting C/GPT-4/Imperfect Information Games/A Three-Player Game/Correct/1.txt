# Step 1: Since player 1 chooses between "L" and "R" without knowing the outcome of the chance event, 
# the decision nodes after each chance event outcome ("A" or "B") are in the same information set for player 1.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 2: Player 2's decision to choose between "l" and "r" does not depend on the specific action taken by player 1 (either "L" under "A" or "L" under "B"),
# but since player 2 does not know player 1's choice, the nodes where player 2 makes a decision are in the same information set.
# However, since player 2's decision only occurs if player 1 chooses "L", and this happens in both branches of the chance event,
# we need to group the decision nodes of player 2 after player 1 chooses "L" in both "A" and "B" scenarios.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)

# Step 3: Similarly, player 3's choice between "a" and "b" does not depend on the specific actions taken by player 1 or player 2,
# but since player 3 does not know player 2's choice, the nodes where player 3 makes a decision are in the same information set.
# This step involves grouping the decision nodes of player 3 after player 2 chooses "l" in both "A" and "B" scenarios, 
# and after player 1 chooses "L" in those scenarios.
