```python
# Step 1: Player 1's decision to choose between "L" and "R" is made without knowing the outcome of the chance event.
# Therefore, the nodes corresponding to the outcomes "A" and "B" of the chance event are in the same information set for Player 1.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 2: Player 2's decision to choose between "l" and "r" is made without knowing Player 1's choice.
# Since Player 1's choice of "L" leads to this decision, and Player 2 does not know if "A" or "B" was the chance outcome,
# the nodes corresponding to "A->L" and "B->L" are in the same information set for Player 2.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)

# Step 3: Player 3's decision to choose between "a" and "b" is made without knowing Player 2's choice of "l".
# Since this decision is reached after Player 2 chooses "l" following Player 1's choice of "L", and without knowledge of the chance event,
# the nodes corresponding to "A->L->l" and "B->L->l" are in the same information set for Player 3.
# However, since Player 3's decision is also independent of Player 1's initial choice between "A" and "B" (due to the lack of knowledge),
# and only one path leads to Player 3's decision, there's no need to group nodes for Player 3 as all paths are unique to their decision.

This code constructs the extensive-form game as described, with a chance event at the beginning, followed by sequential decisions by Player 1, Player 2, and Player 3. Imperfect information is handled according to the instructions, ensuring that players make decisions without knowledge of previous moves or the outcome of the chance event.
