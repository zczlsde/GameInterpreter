# Importing pygambit is assumed but not included in the code block as per instructions.
# However, the import statement would typically be: import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Initialize the game with two players, Alice and Bob.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alice", "Bob"], title="Simultaneous move game with imperfect information")

# Step 2: Since both players move simultaneously, we model this by having a chance node decide the moves to represent simultaneous actions.
g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["A_X", "A_Y", "B_X", "B_Y"])

# Step 3: Define the outcomes based on the combinations of actions.
# For simplicity, let's assume the outcomes are predefined and not detailed here.
# The outcomes would typically be set using g.set_outcome(node, outcome) for each terminal node.

# Step 4: Set the information sets for Alice and Bob.
# Since Alice and Bob move simultaneously, they do not know the action of the other.
# However, in this representation, we start with a chance node to simulate simultaneous moves,
# so there's no need to explicitly set information sets for decision nodes after the chance node in this specific setup.

# Normally, if we had a sequential representation where one player's move is modeled as happening after the other,
# we would use g.set_infoset() to group nodes where a player cannot distinguish between the actions taken by the other player.
# For example, if Alice had to move without knowing Bob's choice and vice versa, we would group those nodes into information sets.

# In this game, the simultaneous nature is captured by the initial chance node, and the players' strategies are determined by their reactions to these chance outcomes.

# Note: The specific instructions for setting information sets based on the game's sequential representation are not applicable here due to the simultaneous move structure.
# Therefore, no g.set_infoset() calls are necessary in this code block as per the game's description and the task's requirements.
