```python
# Step 1: Since the driver cannot distinguish between junctions X and Y, these represent decision nodes with imperfect information.
# Step 2: We assume that the game starts at a chance node (representing nature's move) that decides whether the driver is at junction X or Y.
# Step 3: From each of these junctions (X and Y), the driver has two actions: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# Step 4: The decision nodes following the chance node for junction X and Y must be grouped into the same information set because the driver cannot tell the difference between these junctions.

# Assuming the game tree has been constructed up to the point where the driver makes a decision at junction X and Y,
# and these decision nodes are represented as children of the root's children (for simplicity, let's say root.children[0] is X and root.children[1] is Y),
# we group these decision nodes into the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Initialize the game with a title and a chance player to represent nature's move.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Driver"], title="Absent-minded driver game")

# Step 2: Append a chance move at the root to represent the driver's initial position (junction X or Y) with equal probabilities.
g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["At X", "At Y"])
# Set the probabilities for reaching junction X or Y. Assuming equal probabilities for simplicity.
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.infoset, [gbt.Rational(1, 2), gbt.Rational(1, 2)])

# Step 3: Append moves for the driver at both junctions X and Y.
# For junction X (root.children[0]), the driver can EXIT or CONTINUE.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])
# For junction Y (root.children[1]), the driver can EXIT or CONTINUE.
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Step 4: Since the driver cannot distinguish between junctions X and Y, group these decision nodes into the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define outcomes for each action.
# If the driver EXITS at junction X, they reach destination A with a payoff of 0.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([0], label="Reach A"))
# If the driver CONTINUES at junction X, they eventually reach destination C with a payoff of 1.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([1], label="Reach C"))
# If the driver EXITS at junction Y, they reach destination B with a payoff of 4.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([4], label="Reach B"))
# If the driver CONTINUES at junction Y, they also eventually reach destination C with a payoff of 1.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1], label="Reach C"))

# Save the EFG

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the absent-minded driver problem using the pygambit library. The game starts with a chance move to decide whether the driver is at junction X or Y, with equal probabilities. Since the driver cannot distinguish between these junctions, the decision nodes at junctions X and Y are grouped into the same information set, reflecting the driver's imperfect information. The outcomes are set based on the driver's actions at each junction.
