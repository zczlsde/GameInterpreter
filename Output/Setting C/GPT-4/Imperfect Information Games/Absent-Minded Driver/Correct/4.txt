# Since the driver cannot distinguish between junction X and Y,

# Let's assume the game starts at junction X (root node), and then moves to junction Y.
# At junction X, the driver has two actions: EXIT (leading to A with payoff 0) or CONTINUE (leading to Y).
# At junction Y, similarly, the driver has two actions: EXIT (leading to B with payoff 4) or CONTINUE (leading to C with payoff 1).
# The decision nodes at X and Y for the action CONTINUE must be grouped in the same information set 
# because the driver cannot distinguish between being at X or Y.

# Assuming g.root is the starting node at junction X, and g.root.children[1] is the node after choosing CONTINUE,
# leading to junction Y. Then, g.root.children[1].children[0] and g.root.children[1].children[1] are the decision nodes at Y.
# We need to group g.root (decision at X for CONTINUE) and g.root.children[1] (decision at Y) in the same information set.
