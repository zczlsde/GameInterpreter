```python
# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. The game involves imperfect information as both players can see all actions taken by each other.
# 2. Alice makes the first move with actions Take or Push, creating the first decision node.
# 3. Bob makes the second move after Alice with actions Take or Push, creating the second decision node.
# 4. Alice makes the third move after Bob with actions Take or Push, creating the third decision node.
# 5. Bob makes the final move after Alice with actions Take or Push, creating the final decision node.
# 6. Since both players can see all actions taken by each other, group the decision nodes for Alice and Bob in the same information set.
