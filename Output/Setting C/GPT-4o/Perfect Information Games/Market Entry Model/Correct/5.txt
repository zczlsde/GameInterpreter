# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out. This is Firm 2's decision node.
# 2. If Firm 2 stays out, the game ends, and no further decisions are made.
# 3. If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 must decide whether to Fight or Accommodate.
# 4. Firm 1's decision is based on Firm 2's entry, but Firm 1 knows Firm 2's decision because it is sequential.
# 5. Since Firm 1 knows Firm 2's decision, there is no imperfect information for Firm 1.
# 6. Therefore, there are no information sets to be set for Firm 1, as Firm 1's decision is not based on imperfect information.

# Conclusion: There are no information sets to be set in this game because Firm 1's decision is made with perfect information.

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Firm 1 and Firm 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Firm 1", "Firm 2"], title="Monopoly Entry Game")

# Step 1: Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out
g.append_move(g.root, "Firm 2", ["Enter", "Stay Out"])

# Step 2: If Firm 2 stays out, the game ends with payoffs for both firms
stay_out_outcome = g.add_outcome([3, 0], label="Stay Out")  # Firm 1 earns more if Firm 2 stays out
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], stay_out_outcome)

# Step 3: If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 decides whether to Fight or Accommodate
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Firm 1", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])

# Step 4: Set the outcomes based on Firm 1's decision
fight_outcome = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Fight")  # Firm 2 earns more if Firm 1 fights
accommodate_outcome = g.add_outcome([2, 2], label="Accommodate")  # Both firms earn equally if Firm 1 accommodates

# Assign outcomes to the respective nodes
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], fight_outcome)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], accommodate_outcome)

# Conclusion: There are no information sets to be set in this game because Firm 1's decision is made with perfect information.

# Save the EFG
