# Step 1: Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out.
# Step 2: If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 must decide whether to Fight or Accommodate.
# Step 3: Since Firm 1's decision depends on Firm 2's action, there is no simultaneous move or hidden information for Firm 1.
# Step 4: Therefore, there is no need to set any information sets in this game as there is no imperfect information.

# No set_infoset() function is needed because there is no imperfect information in this sequential game.
