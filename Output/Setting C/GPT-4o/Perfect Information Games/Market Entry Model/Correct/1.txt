```python
# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out. This is Firm 2's decision node.
# 2. If Firm 2 stays out, the game ends, and no further decisions are made.
# 3. If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 must decide whether to Fight or Accommodate. This is Firm 1's decision node.
# 4. Firm 1's decision is made after Firm 2's decision, so there is no simultaneous move here.
# 5. Since Firm 1 knows Firm 2's decision (whether to enter or not), there is no imperfect information for Firm 1.
# 6. Therefore, there are no information sets to be set in this game, as all decisions are made with perfect information.

# No set_infoset() function is needed because there is no imperfect information in this game.

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Firm 1 and Firm 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Firm 1", "Firm 2"], title="Monopoly Entry Game")

# Step 1: Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out
g.append_move(g.root, "Firm 2", ["Enter", "Stay Out"])

# Step 2: If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 decides whether to Fight or Accommodate
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Firm 1", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])

# Define the payoffs for each outcome
# If Firm 2 stays out, Firm 1 earns more
stay_out_outcome = g.add_outcome([3, 0], label="Firm 2 Stays Out")
# If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 accommodates, both firms earn an equal amount
accommodate_outcome = g.add_outcome([2, 2], label="Accommodate")
# If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 fights, Firm 2 earns more than Firm 1
fight_outcome = g.add_outcome([1, 3], label="Fight")

# Set the outcomes for each terminal node
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], stay_out_outcome)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], fight_outcome)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], accommodate_outcome)

# Save the EFG
