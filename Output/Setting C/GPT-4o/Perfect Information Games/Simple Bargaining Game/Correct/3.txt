# Thought process:
# 1. The game involves two players, A and B, negotiating the division of 10,000 pounds.
# 2. Player A proposes a distribution plan first, and Player B decides to accept or reject.
# 3. If Player B rejects, Player B proposes an equal split, and Player A decides to accept or reject.
# 4. If Player A rejects, Player A proposes a new plan, and Player B must accept.
# 5. There is no simultaneous move or hidden information in this game, so there are no information sets to set.
# 6. Each player knows the actions taken by the other player at each decision point.

# Since there is no imperfect information in this game, no information sets need to be set.
```
