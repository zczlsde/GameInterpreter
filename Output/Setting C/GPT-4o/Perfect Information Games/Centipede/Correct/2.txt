# Thought process:
# 1. The game is fully observable, meaning there is no imperfect information.
# 2. Each player can see the actions taken by the other player.
# 3. Therefore, there are no information sets to be set for this game.
# 4. No g.set_infoset() function is needed as there is no imperfect information.

# No g.set_infoset() function is needed.
