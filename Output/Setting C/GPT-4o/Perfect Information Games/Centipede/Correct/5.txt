```python
# Thought process:
# 1. Alice makes the first move with two piles: 4 coins and 1 coin.
# 2. Alice can either take the larger pile or push both piles to Bob.
# 3. If Alice pushes, the piles double, and Bob makes a decision.
# 4. Bob can either take the larger pile or push back to Alice.
# 5. If Bob pushes, the piles double again, and Alice makes a decision.
# 6. Alice can either take the larger pile or push back to Bob.
# 7. If Alice pushes, the piles double again, and Bob makes a decision.
# 8. Bob can either take the larger pile or push back to Alice.
# 9. The game ends after Bob's final decision.
# 10. All actions are visible to both players, so there is no imperfect information.
# 11. Since there is no imperfect information, no information sets need to be set.

# No set_infoset() function is needed because all actions are visible to both players.
