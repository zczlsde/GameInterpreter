```python
# Thought process:
# 1. The game is fully observable, meaning there is no imperfect information.
# 2. Each player can see the actions taken by the other player.
# 3. Therefore, there are no information sets to be set for this game.
# 4. No g.set_infoset() function is needed as there is no imperfect information.

# Since there is no imperfect information, no set_infoset() function is required.

import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Alice and Bob
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alice", "Bob"], title="Coin Pile Game")

# Alice makes the first move: she can either take the larger pile or push the piles to Bob
g.append_move(g.root, "Alice", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Alice takes the larger pile, the game ends with Alice getting 4 coins and Bob getting 1 coin
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0], g.add_outcome([4, 1], label="Alice takes 4"))

# If Alice pushes, the piles double and it's Bob's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Bob", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Bob takes the larger pile, the game ends with Bob getting 8 coins and Alice getting 2 coins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 8], label="Bob takes 8"))

# If Bob pushes, the piles double again and it's Alice's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1], "Alice", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Alice takes the larger pile, the game ends with Alice getting 16 coins and Bob getting 4 coins

# If Alice pushes, the piles double again and it's Bob's turn
