# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. The game starts with a chance event determining either "A" or "B" with equal probability.
#    This is represented by the root node having two children: g.root.children[0] (A) and g.root.children[1] (B).

# 2. Player 1 makes a decision between "L" and "R" without knowing the outcome of the chance event.
#    Therefore, Player 1's decision nodes are g.root.children[0].children[0] (A, L) and g.root.children[1].children[0] (B, L).
#    Since Player 1 does not know the outcome of the chance event, these nodes should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)

# 3. If Player 1 chooses "L", Player 2 makes a decision between "l" and "r".
#    Player 2 does not see Player 1's choice, so Player 2's decision nodes are:
#    g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0] (A, L, l) and g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0] (B, L, l).
#    These nodes should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0].infoset)

# 4. If Player 2 chooses "l", Player 3 makes a decision between "a" and "b".
#    Player 3 does not know Player 2's prior choice, so Player 3's decision nodes are:
#    g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0].children[0] (A, L, l, a) and g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0].children[0] (B, L, l, a).
#    These nodes should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0].children[0].infoset)
