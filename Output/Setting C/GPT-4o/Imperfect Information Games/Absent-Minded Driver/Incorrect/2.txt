# The game involves an absent-minded driver who cannot distinguish between junctions X and Y.
# This means the driver has imperfect information about their location.
# The driver has two decision nodes: one at junction X and one at junction Y.
# Since the driver cannot tell the difference between these two junctions, they should be in the same information set.

# Assuming g.root.children[0] is the decision node at junction X and g.root.children[1] is the decision node at junction Y.

# Group the decision nodes at junction X and junction Y in the same information set.

# If the driver chooses to CONTINUE at junction X, they reach junction Y.
# At junction Y, the driver again has two actions: EXIT or CONTINUE.
