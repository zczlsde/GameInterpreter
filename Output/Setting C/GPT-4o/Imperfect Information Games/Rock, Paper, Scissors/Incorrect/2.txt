# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. In the game of rock-paper-scissors, both players make their moves simultaneously.
# 2. This means that each player does not know the move of the other player when making their decision.
# 3. To represent this in a sequential game structure, we can assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# 4. Let's assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.
# 5. Player 1 has three possible actions: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
# 6. Player 2 also has three possible actions: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
# 7. Player 2, moving simultaneously, does not know which action Player 1 has taken.
# 8. Therefore, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming g is the game tree object and g.root is the root node:
# Player 1's actions lead to three different nodes: g.root.children[0] (Rock), g.root.children[1] (Paper), g.root.children[2] (Scissors).
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0], and g.root.children[2].children[0].
# These nodes should be in the same information set because Player 2 does not know Player 1's action.
