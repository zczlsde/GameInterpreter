# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. In the game of rock-paper-scissors, both players choose their actions simultaneously.
# 2. This means that each player does not know the action chosen by the other player at the time of their decision.
# 3. To represent this in a sequential game structure, we can assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# 4. However, since the players move simultaneously, the second player does not know the first player's action.
# 5. Therefore, the decision nodes for the second player should be grouped into the same information set, indicating that the second player cannot distinguish between the different actions of the first player.

# Since the game is symmetric and both players have the same set of actions (rock, paper, scissors), we can assume:
# - Player 1's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (rock), g.root.children[1] (paper), and g.root.children[2] (scissors).
# - Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0], and g.root.children[2].children[0].

# Group Player 2's decision nodes into the same information set, as Player 2 cannot distinguish between Player 1's actions.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
```
