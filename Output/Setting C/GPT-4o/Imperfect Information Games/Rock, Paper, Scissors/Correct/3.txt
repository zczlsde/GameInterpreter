# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. In the game of rock-paper-scissors, both players choose their actions simultaneously.
# 2. This means that each player does not know the action chosen by the other player at the time of their decision.
# 3. To represent this in a sequential game structure, we can assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# 4. Let's assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.
# 5. Player 1 has three possible actions: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
# 6. Player 2 also has three possible actions: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
# 7. Since Player 2 does not know Player 1's action when making their decision, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
# 8. Therefore, we need to group all of Player 2's decision nodes (corresponding to Player 1's actions) in the same information set.

# Group Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2], g.root.children[1].infoset)
