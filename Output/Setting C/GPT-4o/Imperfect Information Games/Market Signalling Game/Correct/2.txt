# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. The game begins with a chance node that determines the strength of the new manufacturer: strong (S) or weak (W).
# 2. The new manufacturer sends a signal, either strong (S) or weak (W), which is observed by the existing manufacturer.
# 3. The existing manufacturer does not know the actual strength of the new manufacturer, only the signal.
# 4. The existing manufacturer must decide to either compete aggressively (F) or accommodate (A) based on the signal.
# 5. The decision nodes for the existing manufacturer are based on the signals received, not the actual strength.
# 6. Therefore, the existing manufacturer cannot distinguish between the actual strength of the new manufacturer when making a decision.
# 7. We need to group the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer based on the signals, not the actual strength.

# Grouping the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer based on the signals:
# - For the strong signal, the existing manufacturer cannot distinguish between the new manufacturer being strong or weak.
# - For the weak signal, the existing manufacturer cannot distinguish between the new manufacturer being strong or weak.

# Set the information sets for the existing manufacturer's decision nodes:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[0].infoset)  # Strong signal
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[3].children[0].infoset)  # Weak signal
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: New Manufacturer and Existing Manufacturer
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["New Manufacturer", "Existing Manufacturer"],
                      title="Market Entry Game with Signaling")

# Step 1: The game begins with a chance node that determines the strength of the new manufacturer: strong (S) or weak (W).
g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["Strong", "Weak"])

# Set the probabilities for the chance node
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.infoset, [gbt.Rational(2, 3), gbt.Rational(1, 3)])

# Step 2: The new manufacturer sends a signal, either strong (S) or weak (W), which is observed by the existing manufacturer.
# For the strong new manufacturer
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "New Manufacturer", ["Strong Signal", "Weak Signal"])
# For the weak new manufacturer
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "New Manufacturer", ["Strong Signal", "Weak Signal"])

# Step 3: The existing manufacturer does not know the actual strength of the new manufacturer, only the signal.
# Step 4: The existing manufacturer must decide to either compete aggressively (F) or accommodate (A) based on the signal.
# For the strong signal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[0], "Existing Manufacturer", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[0], "Existing Manufacturer", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])
# For the weak signal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "Existing Manufacturer", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1], "Existing Manufacturer", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])

# Step 5: The decision nodes for the existing manufacturer are based on the signals received, not the actual strength.
# Step 6: Therefore, the existing manufacturer cannot distinguish between the actual strength of the new manufacturer when making a decision.
# Step 7: We need to group the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer based on the signals, not the actual strength.

# Grouping the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer based on the signals:
# - For the strong signal, the existing manufacturer cannot distinguish between the new manufacturer being strong or weak.

# Set the information sets for the existing manufacturer's decision nodes:

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)  # Weak signal

# Set the payoffs for each scenario
# Strong manufacturer, strong signal
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([1, 0], label="Strong-Fight"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([3, 1], label="Strong-Accommodate"))
