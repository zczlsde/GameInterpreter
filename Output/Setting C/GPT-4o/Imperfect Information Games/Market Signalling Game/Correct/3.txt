# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. The game begins with a chance node that determines the strength of the new manufacturer: strong (S) or weak (W).
# 2. The new manufacturer sends a signal, either strong (S) or weak (W), which is observed by the existing manufacturer.
# 3. The existing manufacturer does not know the actual strength of the new manufacturer, only the signal.
# 4. The existing manufacturer must decide to either compete aggressively (F) or accommodate (A) based on the signal.
# 5. Since the existing manufacturer cannot distinguish between the actual strength of the new manufacturer, 
#    the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer should be grouped in the same information set.

# Grouping the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer based on the signal received:
# - The existing manufacturer receives a strong signal, but the new manufacturer could be either strong or weak.
# - The existing manufacturer receives a weak signal, but the new manufacturer could be either strong or weak.

# Therefore, we need to group the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer based on the signal received.

# Group the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer when the signal is strong:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[0].infoset)

# Group the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer when the signal is weak:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[3].children[0].infoset)

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: New Manufacturer and Existing Manufacturer
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["New Manufacturer", "Existing Manufacturer"],
                      title="Market Entry Game with Signaling")

# Step 1: The game begins with a chance node that determines the strength of the new manufacturer: strong (S) or weak (W).
g.append_move(g.root, g.players.chance, ["Strong", "Weak"])

# Set the probabilities for the chance node: 2/3 for Strong and 1/3 for Weak
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.infoset, [gbt.Rational(2, 3), gbt.Rational(1, 3)])

# Step 2: The new manufacturer sends a signal, either strong (S) or weak (W).
# For both strength types, the new manufacturer can send either a strong or weak signal.
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "New Manufacturer", ["Strong Signal", "Weak Signal"])

# Step 3: The existing manufacturer observes the signal and must decide to either compete aggressively (F) or accommodate (A).
# The existing manufacturer does not know the actual strength of the new manufacturer, only the signal.
# Therefore, we need to group the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer based on the signal received.

# Append moves for the existing manufacturer based on the signal received

# Group the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer when the signal is weak:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)

# Step 4: Set the payoffs for each scenario based on the actions taken by the players
# Strong manufacturer sends strong signal
