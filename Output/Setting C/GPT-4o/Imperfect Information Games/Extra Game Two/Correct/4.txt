```python
# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. Player 1 makes the first move with three options: A, B, and C.
# 2. Player 2 moves next, without knowing Player 1's choice, and can select either D or E.
#    This means Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1's choices A, B, and C should be in the same information set.
# 3. Player 1 moves again, choosing between F or G, but this is after Player 2's move, so no need to group these nodes.
# 4. Player 3 makes the final decision between Q and W, which is after Player 1's second move, so no need to group these nodes.

# Group Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set because Player 2 does not know Player 1's choice.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)  # Group decision nodes after Player 1's choice A and B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2], g.root.children[1].infoset)  # Group decision nodes after Player 1's choice C with A and B
