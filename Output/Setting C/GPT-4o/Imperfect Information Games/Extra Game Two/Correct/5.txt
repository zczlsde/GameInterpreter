# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. The game involves imperfect information because Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice.
# 2. Player 1 has three options: A, B, and C. These are the first moves in the game.
# 3. Player 2 moves next, choosing between D and E, but does not know Player 1's choice. 
#    Therefore, Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1's choices A, B, and C should be in the same information set.
# 4. Player 1 then has a choice between F and G, but this is after Player 2's decision, so it does not affect the information set for Player 2.
# 5. Player 3's decision is at the end and does not involve imperfect information related to Player 1's initial choice.

# Group Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set because Player 2 does not know Player 1's choice.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)  # Group decision nodes after Player 1's choice A and B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2], g.root.children[1].infoset)  # Group decision nodes after Player 1's choice C with A and B
