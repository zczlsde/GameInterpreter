```python
# Step 1: The game starts with a chance node that randomly selects either "L" or "R".
# These are represented as g.root.children[0] for "L" and g.root.children[1] for "R".

# Step 2: Player 1 observes the outcome of the chance event and selects either l or r.
# This means Player 1 has decision nodes at g.root.children[0].children[0] (for "L" and l) and g.root.children[1].children[0] (for "R" and l).

# Step 3: In the third stage, Player 1 must choose between "A" and "B".
# Player 1 has forgotten the outcome of the first stage and only remembers her decision from the second stage.
# Therefore, Player 1's decision nodes at this stage should be grouped in the same information set.

# Group the decision nodes for Player 1 in the third stage in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[0].children[1].infoset)
```

This code block sets the information set for Player 1's decision nodes in the third stage of the game, where Player 1 has forgotten the outcome of the first stage and only remembers her decision from the second stage.
