```python
# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. Player 1 has three actions: A, B, and C. 
#    These actions are represented by the children of the root node: g.root.children[0] (A), g.root.children[1] (B), and g.root.children[2] (C).

# 2. Player 2 knows when action A was taken, so there is no imperfect information for Player 2 when Player 1 chooses A.
#    However, Player 2 cannot distinguish between actions B and C, so these nodes should be in the same information set.

# 3. Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1's actions B and C are:
#    - g.root.children[1] (B) and g.root.children[2] (C).
#    Player 2 has three options: D, E, and F at these nodes.

# 4. Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between B and C, we need to group these nodes in the same information set.

# Set the information set for Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1's actions B and C.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1], g.root.children[2].infoset)
```
