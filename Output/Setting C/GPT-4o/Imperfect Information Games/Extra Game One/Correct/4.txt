```python
# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. Player 1 has three actions: A, B, and C. 
#    These actions are represented by the children of the root node.

# 2. Player 2 knows when action A was taken, so there is no imperfect information for action A.
#    However, Player 2 cannot distinguish between actions B and C.

# 3. Therefore, Player 2's decision nodes after actions B and C should be grouped in the same information set.

# 4. Player 2 has three options: D, E, and F. 
#    If Player 2 chooses F, the game ends. 
#    If Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1 has a choice between actions G and H.

# 5. Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between actions B and C, 
#    Player 2's decision nodes after actions B and C should be grouped in the same information set.

# Group Player 2's decision nodes after actions B and C in the same information set
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1], g.root.children[2].infoset)
