# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. Player 1 has three actions: A, B, and C. These are the initial moves from the root node.
# 2. Player 2 knows when action A was taken, so the decision node for Player 2 after action A is separate.
# 3. Player 2 cannot distinguish between actions B and C, so the decision nodes for Player 2 after actions B and C should be in the same information set.
# 4. Player 2 has three options: D, E, and F. Choosing F ends the game.
# 5. If Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1 has a choice between actions G and H.
# 6. Choosing H ends the game.
# 7. If Player 1 chooses G, Player 2 then decides between actions Q and W.

# Group the decision nodes for Player 2 after actions B and C in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1], g.root.children[2].infoset)
