# Step 1: Player 1, the leader, makes a choice between "S" and "C".
# Step 2: Player 2, the follower, tries to interpret Player 1's choice.
# Due to the misinterpretation probability, Player 2's decision nodes are based on what they perceive Player 1 chose.
# Step 3: Player 2's decision nodes are grouped into information sets based on their perception, not the actual choice of Player 1.

# Assuming the game tree is structured such that:
# g.root.children[0] corresponds to Player 1 choosing "S"
# g.root.children[1] corresponds to Player 1 choosing "C"

# Player 2 perceives Player 1's choice:
# g.root.children[0].children[0] corresponds to Player 2 perceiving "S" when Player 1 chose "S"
# g.root.children[0].children[1] corresponds to Player 2 perceiving "C" when Player 1 chose "S"
# g.root.children[1].children[0] corresponds to Player 2 perceiving "S" when Player 1 chose "C"
# g.root.children[1].children[1] corresponds to Player 2 perceiving "C" when Player 1 chose "C"

# Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between the actual choice of Player 1 and their perception,
# we need to group the decision nodes where Player 2 perceives "S" together and where Player 2 perceives "C" together.

# Grouping Player 2's decision nodes where they perceive "S"
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)

# Grouping Player 2's decision nodes where they perceive "C"
