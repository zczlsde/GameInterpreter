# Step 1: Player 1 (the leader) makes a choice between "S" and "C".
# Step 2: Player 2 (the follower) tries to interpret Player 1's choice, but there is a small probability of misinterpretation.
# Step 3: Player 2 makes a decision based on their interpretation of Player 1's choice.
# Step 4: Since Player 2's interpretation is imperfect, we need to group Player 2's decision nodes into information sets based on their perception.

# Assuming Player 1 chooses "S", Player 2 perceives it as "S" with high probability and "C" with low probability.
# Assuming Player 1 chooses "C", Player 2 perceives it as "C" with high probability and "S" with low probability.

# Player 2's decision nodes based on perception:
# - If Player 1 chooses "S", Player 2 perceives "S" (g.root.children[0].children[0]) or "C" (g.root.children[0].children[1]).
# - If Player 1 chooses "C", Player 2 perceives "C" (g.root.children[1].children[1]) or "S" (g.root.children[1].children[0]).

# Group Player 2's decision nodes into information sets based on their perception:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)  # Perceived "S"
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)  # Perceived "C"
