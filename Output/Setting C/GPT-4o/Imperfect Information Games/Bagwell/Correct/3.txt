```python
# Step 1: Player 1 (the leader) makes a choice between "S" and "C".
# Step 2: Player 2 (the follower) tries to interpret Player 1's choice, but there is a small probability of misinterpretation.
# Step 3: Player 2 makes a decision based on their interpretation of Player 1's choice.
# Step 4: Since Player 2's interpretation can be incorrect, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming the game tree is structured as follows:
# g.root.children[0] corresponds to Player 1 choosing "S"
# g.root.children[1] corresponds to Player 1 choosing "C"
# Player 2's interpretation of Player 1's choice leads to decision nodes:
# g.root.children[0].children[0] (interprets "S" as "S")
# g.root.children[0].children[1] (interprets "S" as "C")
# g.root.children[1].children[0] (interprets "C" as "S")
# g.root.children[1].children[1] (interprets "C" as "C")

# Group Player 2's decision nodes based on their interpretation of Player 1's choice.
# Player 2 cannot distinguish between the actual choice of Player 1 due to misinterpretation.

# Group the nodes where Player 2 interprets Player 1's choice as "S"
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)

# Group the nodes where Player 2 interprets Player 1's choice as "C"
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)
```

This code block sets the information sets for Player 2's decision nodes, reflecting the imperfect information due to the possibility of misinterpretation of Player 1's choice.

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Player 1 (Leader) and Player 2 (Follower)
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2"], title="Imperfect Information Game")

# Step 1: Player 1 (the leader) makes a choice between "S" and "C".
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["S", "C"])

# Step 2: Player 2 (the follower) tries to interpret Player 1's choice, but there is a small probability of misinterpretation.
# We model this as a chance move for Player 2's interpretation of Player 1's choice.
# If Player 1 chooses "S", Player 2 interprets it as "S" with 99% probability and as "C" with 1% probability.
# If Player 1 chooses "C", Player 2 interprets it as "C" with 99% probability and as "S" with 1% probability.

# Append chance moves for Player 2's interpretation of Player 1's choice
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], g.players.chance, ["Interprets S as S", "Interprets S as C"])

# Set the probabilities for the chance nodes
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.children[0].infoset, [gbt.Rational(99, 100), gbt.Rational(1, 100)])
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.children[1].infoset, [gbt.Rational(1, 100), gbt.Rational(99, 100)])

# Step 3: Player 2 makes a decision based on their interpretation of Player 1's choice.
# Player 2 chooses between "S" and "C" based on their interpretation.

g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "Player 2", ["S", "C"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[0], "Player 2", ["S", "C"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1], "Player 2", ["S", "C"])

# Step 4: Since Player 2's interpretation can be incorrect, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
# Group Player 2's decision nodes based on their interpretation of Player 1's choice.
