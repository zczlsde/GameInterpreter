# Step 1: Player 1 (the leader) makes a choice between "S" and "C".
# Step 2: Player 2 (the follower) tries to interpret Player 1's choice, but there is a small probability of misinterpretation.
# Step 3: Player 2 makes a decision based on their interpretation of Player 1's choice.

# Since Player 2 may misinterpret Player 1's choice, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set
# when Player 2 perceives Player 1's choice as "S" or "C".

# Player 2's decision nodes when they perceive Player 1's choice as "S" are:
# - g.root.children[0].children[0] (Player 1 chose "S" and Player 2 perceives "S")
# - g.root.children[1].children[0] (Player 1 chose "C" and Player 2 perceives "S")

# Player 2's decision nodes when they perceive Player 1's choice as "C" are:
# - g.root.children[0].children[1] (Player 1 chose "S" and Player 2 perceives "C")
# - g.root.children[1].children[1] (Player 1 chose "C" and Player 2 perceives "C")
