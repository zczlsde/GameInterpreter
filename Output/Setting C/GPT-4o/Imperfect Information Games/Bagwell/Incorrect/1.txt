# Step 1: Player 1, the leader, selects a strategy: either "S" or "C".
# This is a decision node for Player 1, so no information set is needed here.

# Step 2: Player 2, the follower, tries to interpret Player 1's choice.
# There is a small probability of misinterpretation, which introduces imperfect information.
# Player 2's decision nodes are based on what they perceive Player 1's choice to be.

# Step 3: Player 2 picks either "S" or "C" based on their perception.
# Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between the actual choice of Player 1 due to misinterpretation,
# Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Let's assume the following structure:
# g.root.children[0] corresponds to Player 1 choosing "S"
# g.root.children[1] corresponds to Player 1 choosing "C"

# Player 2 perceives Player 1's choice:
# g.root.children[0].children[0] corresponds to Player 2 perceiving "S" and choosing "S"
# g.root.children[0].children[1] corresponds to Player 2 perceiving "S" and choosing "C"
# g.root.children[1].children[0] corresponds to Player 2 perceiving "C" and choosing "S"
# g.root.children[1].children[1] corresponds to Player 2 perceiving "C" and choosing "C"

# Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between the actual choice of Player 1 due to misinterpretation,
# we need to group the decision nodes where Player 2 perceives "S" and "C" in the same information set.
