```python
# Step 1: The driver starts at junction X with two choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# Step 2: If the driver CONTINUES, he moves to junction Y, where he faces the same choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# Step 3: The driver cannot distinguish between being at junction X or Y, implying these decision points are in the same information set.
# Step 4: We need to group the decision nodes at junction X and Y into the same information set for the driver.

# Assuming g.root is the starting node at junction X and g.root.children[1] leads to junction Y,
# we group the decision node at Y (g.root.children[1]) with the decision node at X (g.root) in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root, g.root.children[1].infoset)

import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with a single player, the driver
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Driver"], title="Absent-minded driver problem")

# Step 1: The driver starts at junction X with two choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
g.append_move(g.root, "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Step 2: If the driver CONTINUES, he moves to junction Y, where he faces the same choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# This is represented by appending the same choices to the node reached by choosing CONTINUE at X.
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Step 3: The driver cannot distinguish between being at junction X or Y, implying these decision points are in the same information set.
# Step 4: We need to group the decision nodes at junction X and Y into the same information set for the driver.
# Assuming g.root is the starting node at junction X and g.root.children[1] leads to junction Y,
# we group the decision node at Y (g.root.children[1]) with the decision node at X (g.root) in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root, g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Now, we set the outcomes for each of the terminal nodes.
# If the driver exits at X, the payoff is 0.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0], g.add_outcome([0], label="Exit at X"))

# If the driver continues to Y and then exits, the payoff is 4.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([4], label="Exit at Y"))

# If the driver continues through both X and Y to C, the payoff is 1.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1], label="Continue to C"))
