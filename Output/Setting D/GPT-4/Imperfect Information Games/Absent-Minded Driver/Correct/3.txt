```python
# Step 1: The driver starts at junction X with two choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# Step 2: If the driver CONTINUES, he moves to junction Y, where he faces the same choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# Step 3: The driver cannot distinguish between being at junction X or Y, meaning these decision points are in the same information set.

# Assuming g.root is the starting point at junction X, and g.root.children[1] is the node for CONTINUE leading to junction Y,
# we need to group the decision node at X and the decision node at Y into the same information set.
# Since the driver cannot distinguish between X and Y, both decision nodes (at X and at Y) must be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root, g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Create a new game with a single player, the driver
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Driver"], title="Absent-minded driver problem")

# Step 1: The driver starts at junction X with two choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# This creates the initial decision node at junction X.
g.append_move(g.root, "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Step 2: If the driver CONTINUES, he moves to junction Y, where he faces the same choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# This creates the decision node at junction Y, which is reached by continuing from junction X.
# Note: g.root.children[1] is the node for CONTINUE from junction X to Y.
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Step 3: The driver cannot distinguish between being at junction X or Y, meaning these decision points are in the same information set.
# Since the driver cannot distinguish between X and Y, both decision nodes (at X and at Y) must be in the same information set.
# This is handled by setting the information set of the node at X to be the same as the node at Y.
g.set_infoset(g.root, g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Now, we define the outcomes based on the driver's decisions.
# If the driver exits at junction X, the payoff is 0.

# If the driver exits at junction Y, the payoff is 4.

# If the driver continues at junction Y, the payoff is 1.
