```python
# Step 1: The driver starts at junction X with two choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# Step 2: If the driver CONTINUES, he moves to junction Y, where he faces the same choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# Step 3: The driver cannot distinguish between being at junction X or Y, meaning these decision points are in the same information set.

# Assuming g is the game object and the moves have been appended correctly to the game tree,
# we need to group the decision nodes at junction X and Y into the same information set for the driver.

# Let's say g.root represents the decision node at junction X,
# and g.root.children[1] represents the decision node at junction Y after CONTINUE action at X.

# Grouping junction X and Y decision nodes into the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root, g.root.children[1].infoset)
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game tree with a single player, the driver.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Driver"], title="Absent-minded driver problem")

# Step 1: The driver starts at junction X with two choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# This creates the initial decision node at junction X.
g.append_move(g.root, "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Step 2: If the driver CONTINUES, he moves to junction Y, where he again faces two choices: EXIT or CONTINUE.
# This creates the decision node at junction Y after the CONTINUE action at X.
# Note: The CONTINUE action at X leads to the first child's second option (index 1), hence g.root.children[1].
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Driver", ["EXIT", "CONTINUE"])

# Step 3: The driver cannot distinguish between being at junction X or Y, meaning these decision points are in the same information set.
# Grouping junction X and Y decision nodes into the same information set.
# This is crucial for representing the absent-mindedness of the driver.
g.set_infoset(g.root, g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Setting outcomes for each terminal node:
# Exiting at X leads to A with a payoff of 0.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0], g.add_outcome([0], label="Exit to A"))
# Exiting at Y leads to B with a payoff of 4.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([4], label="Exit to B"))
# Continuing through Y leads to C with a payoff of 1.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1], label="Continue to C"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the absent-minded driver problem. It models the driver's decision-making process at junctions X and Y, incorporating the crucial aspect of imperfect information by grouping the decision nodes at both junctions into the same information set. This reflects the driver's inability to distinguish between being at junction X or Y, capturing the essence of absent-mindedness in the problem.
