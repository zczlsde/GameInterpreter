```python
# Step 1: Player 1 chooses between "S" and "C". This is a decision node for Player 1.
# Step 2: Player 2 receives a signal, which might be a misinterpretation of Player 1's choice. 
#         There's a 1% chance of misinterpretation, so for Player 2, each of Player 1's choices ("S" or "C") 
#         could be perceived as either "S" or "C". This introduces imperfect information for Player 2.
# Step 3: Player 2 then makes a choice based on the perceived action of Player 1. 
#         Since Player 2's perception might be incorrect, Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses "S" 
#         should be in the same information set as the decision nodes after Player 1 chooses "C", 
#         if the perceived action is the same.
#         For example, if Player 2 perceives "S" (regardless of Player 1's actual choice), 
#         those nodes should be in the same information set. The same applies if Player 2 perceives "C".

# Assuming the game tree is constructed with the root being Player 1's decision, 
# followed by a chance node for the misinterpretation, and then Player 2's decisions based on the signal received.

# For simplicity, let's denote:
# - Node S_S as the node where Player 1 chooses "S" and Player 2 correctly perceives "S".
# - Node S_C as the node where Player 1 chooses "S" but Player 2 incorrectly perceives "C".
# - Node C_S as the node where Player 1 chooses "C" but Player 2 incorrectly perceives "S".
# - Node C_C as the node where Player 1 chooses "C" and Player 2 correctly perceives "C".

# Since Player 2's decision nodes based on the perceived action need to be in the same information set:
# Grouping for perceived "S":
g.set_infoset(Node_S_S, Node_C_S.infoset)
# Grouping for perceived "C":
g.set_infoset(Node_S_C, Node_C_C.infoset)

# This setup ensures that Player 2's decisions are grouped by the signal they receive, 
# not by the actual choice of Player 1, reflecting the imperfect information in the game.

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game with imperfect information using the pygambit library. It models a game where Player 1's choice can be misinterpreted by Player 2 with a small probability. The game tree includes decision nodes for Player 1, chance nodes to model the misinterpretation, and decision nodes for Player 2 based on the perceived action. The outcomes are set based on the actual choices of Player 1 and Player 2, reflecting the payoffs for each combination of actions. The use of `g.set_infoset()` ensures that Player 2's decisions are grouped by the signal received, not by Player 1's actual choice, capturing the essence of imperfect information in the game.
