```python
# Step 1: Player 1 chooses between S and C. This is a decision node for Player 1.
# Step 2: There is a chance node after Player 1's decision, representing the possibility of misinterpretation by Player 2.
# Step 3: Player 2 makes a decision based on what they believe Player 1's choice was. However, due to the chance of misinterpretation, Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses S and after Player 1 chooses C are not perfectly informative.
# Step 4: To represent the imperfect information for Player 2, we group the decision nodes following the chance node's outcomes (misinterpretation chance) into the same information set for Player 2.

# Assuming the game tree has been constructed up to the chance node, and the outcomes of the chance node have been defined as follows:
# If Player 1 chooses S, there are two outcomes at the chance node: correctly interpreting S, and misinterpreting it as C.
# If Player 1 chooses C, there are also two outcomes at the chance node: correctly interpreting C, and misinterpreting it as S.

# For Player 2, the decision nodes following each of these outcomes should be in the same information set because Player 2 cannot distinguish between the actual choice of Player 1 and the misinterpretation.

# Let's assume the following structure for the game tree:
# g.root.children[0] is the node after Player 1 chooses S and Player 2 correctly interprets this choice.
# g.root.children[1] is the node after Player 1 chooses S but Player 2 misinterprets this as C.
# g.root.children[2] is the node after Player 1 chooses C but Player 2 misinterprets this as S.
# g.root.children[3] is the node after Player 1 chooses C and Player 2 correctly interprets this choice.

# Grouping the decision nodes for Player 2 into the same information set:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)  # Grouping nodes for when Player 1 chooses S
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2], g.root.children[3].infoset)  # Grouping nodes for when Player 1 chooses C

# This setup ensures that Player 2's decision nodes, which are based on their belief about Player 1's choice, are correctly grouped according to the imperfect information structure of the game.
