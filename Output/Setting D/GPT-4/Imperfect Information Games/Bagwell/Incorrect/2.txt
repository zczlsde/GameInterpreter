# Step 1: Player 1 chooses between S and C. This is a decision node for Player 1.
# Step 2: There is a chance node after Player 1's decision, representing the small chance of misinterpretation by Player 2.
# Step 3: Player 2 then makes a decision based on what they believe Player 1's choice was. However, due to the chance of misinterpretation, Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1 chooses S or C are not perfectly informed.
# Step 4: To represent the imperfect information for Player 2, we group the decision nodes that result from the chance node's outcomes (misinterpretation or correct interpretation) into the same information set.

# Assuming the game tree is constructed and the chance node outcomes are added, we proceed to set the information sets for Player 2.
# Let's say g.root.children[0] is the node where Player 1 chooses S, and g.root.children[1] is where Player 1 chooses C.
# After each of these, there's a chance node leading to two outcomes: correctly interpreting Player 1's choice or misinterpreting it.
# For simplicity, let's assume g.root.children[0].children[0] and g.root.children[1].children[1] are the nodes where Player 2 correctly interprets Player 1's choice,
# and g.root.children[0].children[1] and g.root.children[1].children[0] are where Player 2 misinterprets Player 1's choice.

# Grouping the nodes where Player 2 correctly interprets Player 1's choice (no need to group as they are already in correct information sets by default).

# Grouping the nodes where Player 2 misinterprets Player 1's choice into the same information set.
