# Step 1: Player 1 chooses between "S" and "C". This is a straightforward decision with no imperfect information yet.
# Step 2: Player 2 tries to interpret Player 1's choice, but there's a chance of misinterpretation. 
# This introduces imperfect information for Player 2, as they do not know for sure what Player 1 chose.
# Step 3: To represent the imperfect information for Player 2, we need to group the decision nodes where Player 2 
# perceives Player 1's action as "S" together, and similarly, group the nodes where Player 2 perceives Player 1's 
# action as "C" together, regardless of what Player 1 actually chose.

# Assuming g.root.children[0] is the node where Player 1 chooses "S" and it leads to two nodes for Player 2 
# (one where Player 2 correctly interprets "S" and one where Player 2 incorrectly interprets it as "C"),
# and g.root.children[1] is the node where Player 1 chooses "C" leading to two similar nodes for Player 2.

# Grouping nodes for Player 2's perception of Player 1 choosing "S"
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset) # Correct interpretation of "S" and incorrect interpretation as "C" when "C" was chosen
# Grouping nodes for Player 2's perception of Player 1 choosing "C"
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset) # Incorrect interpretation as "C" when "S" was chosen and correct interpretation of "C"
