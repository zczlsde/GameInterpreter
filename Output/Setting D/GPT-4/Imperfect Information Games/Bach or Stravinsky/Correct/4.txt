# Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously, we model this as if one player moves first and the other second for representation.
# However, because the second player (in our sequential representation) does not know what the first player chose, all decision nodes of the second player belong to the same information set.

# Assume Alexis moves first and Beverley moves second in our sequential representation.
# Alexis has two actions: Bach or Stravinsky.
# Beverley, moving second, has two actions at each of her decision nodes: Bach or Stravinsky.
# But since Beverley makes her decision without knowing Alexis's choice, her decision nodes must be grouped in the same information set.

# Let's represent the game in Pygambit with Alexis as Player 1 and Beverley as Player 2.
# Alexis's decision nodes are created first (though in the game they choose simultaneously).
# Beverley's decision nodes, which follow from each of Alexis's decisions, are then created.
# Since Beverley cannot distinguish between Alexis choosing Bach or Stravinsky, we group Beverley's decision nodes into the same information set.

# Group Beverley's decision nodes following Alexis's choice of Bach with those following Alexis's choice of Stravinsky into the same information set.
