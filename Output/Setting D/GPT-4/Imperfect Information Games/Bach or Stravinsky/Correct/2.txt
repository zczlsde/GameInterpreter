# Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously, we model this as if one player moves first and the other second for representation.
# However, the second player (in our sequential representation) does not know the action of the first player due to the simultaneous move nature of the game.
# Therefore, all decision nodes of the second player belong to the same information set as they cannot distinguish which action the first player has taken.

# Assuming Alexis moves first in our representation and chooses between Bach or Stravinsky, we create two decision nodes for Beverley under each of Alexis's decisions.
# These nodes for Beverley are indistinguishable from her perspective, representing the imperfect information in the game.
# We group these nodes into the same information set to reflect that Beverley knows she is at one of these nodes but not exactly which one.
