# Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously, we model this as if one player moves first and the other second for representation.
# However, the second player (in our sequential representation) does not know what the first player chose because the decisions are made simultaneously in reality.
# Therefore, all decision nodes of the second player belong to the same information set as they cannot distinguish between the actions taken by the first player.

# Assuming Alexis moves first in our representation and chooses between Bach and Stravinsky, we create two decision nodes for Beverley under each of Alexis's choices.
# These nodes for Beverley are indistinguishable from her perspective, representing the simultaneous move aspect of the game.
# We group Beverley's decision nodes into the same information set.
