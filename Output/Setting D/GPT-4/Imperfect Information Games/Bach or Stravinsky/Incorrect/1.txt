# Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously and independently,
# we model this as if one player moves first and the other second for representation,
# but in reality, they don't know each other's choices when deciding.

# Assume Alexis moves first and Beverley moves second.
# Alexis has two actions: Bach or Stravinsky.
# Beverley, moving "second" in our sequential representation, has the same two actions: Bach or Stravinsky.
# However, since Beverley's decision is made simultaneously with Alexis's decision,
# Beverley cannot know Alexis's choice when making her own decision.

# Therefore, Beverley's decision nodes after choosing Bach or Stravinsky must be grouped in the same information set
# to represent that Beverley does not know Alexis's choice.

# However, in this specific game setup, since both players make their decisions simultaneously and there's no sequential structure to exploit for information sets,
# and the game description does not specify any sequential moves or hidden actions,
# there's technically no need to set information sets using g.set_infoset() as there are no sequential decisions to group under information sets for this simultaneous move game.

# In a typical representation of this game in strategic (normal) form, we wouldn't use information sets,
# as those are concepts used in extensive form games where decisions are made sequentially.
# Thus, in this specific case, there's no need for g.set_infoset() calls in the code.
