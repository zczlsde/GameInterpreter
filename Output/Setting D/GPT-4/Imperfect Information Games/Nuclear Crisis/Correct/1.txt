# Since Country B moves after Country A without knowing whether Country A chose to retreat or detonate,
# Country B's decision nodes after Country A chooses to escalate and then Country B also chooses to escalate,
# are in the same information set. This is because Country B cannot distinguish between Country A's actions
# of retreat (R) or detonate (D) when making its own decision.

# Assuming g.root is the starting node where Country A decides to escalate or ignore.
# g.root.children[0] is the node where Country A chooses to escalate.
# g.root.children[0].children[1] is the node where Country B chooses to escalate as well.
# g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0] is the node where Country A chooses retreat (R) after both have escalated.
# g.root.children[0].children[1].children[1] is the node where Country A chooses detonate (D) after both have escalated.

# Therefore, the decision nodes for Country B, which are after Country A's decision to either retreat or detonate,
# should be grouped in the same information set as Country B moves without knowing Country A's prior action.
