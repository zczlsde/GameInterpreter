# Since Country B moves after Country A without knowing whether Country A chose to retreat or detonate,
# Country B's decision nodes after Country A chooses to escalate and then Country B also chooses to escalate,
# are in the same information set. This is because Country B cannot distinguish between Country A's choice of
# retreat or detonate when making its own decision.

# Assuming g.root is the starting node where Country A decides to escalate or ignore.
# g.root.children[0] is the node where Country A chooses to escalate.
# g.root.children[0].children[1] is the node where Country B also chooses to escalate, leading to the nuclear crisis scenario.
# g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0] is the node where Country A chooses to retreat in the nuclear crisis.
# g.root.children[0].children[1].children[1] is the node where Country A chooses to detonate in the nuclear crisis.
# Both of these nodes lead to decision nodes for Country B, which should be in the same information set as Country B is unaware of Country A's move.

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the nuclear crisis scenario between Country A and Country B. It starts with Country A's decision to either escalate or ignore a provocation. If Country A escalates, Country B can choose to back down or escalate further, leading to a nuclear crisis scenario. In this scenario, both countries decide whether to retreat or detonate without knowing the other's decision, represented by placing Country B's decisions in the same information set to model imperfect information. The outcomes are set based on the decisions made, including the catastrophic outcome if both decide to detonate.
