# Stage 1: Chance node determines L or R with equal probabilities.
# Stage 2: Player 1 observes the outcome of stage 1 and chooses either l or r.
# This means Player 1 has perfect information at this stage and no information set grouping is needed here.

# Stage 3: Player 1 chooses again either A or B but has forgotten the outcome of stage 1.
# She only remembers her choice in stage 2, not whether the chance node resulted in L or R.
# Therefore, for each of Player 1's choices in stage 2 (l or r), the decision nodes in stage 3 (A or B) 
# cannot be distinguished based on the initial chance outcome. 
# This necessitates grouping the stage 3 decision nodes based on the stage 2 action.

# For action l in stage 2, the decision nodes for choosing A or B in stage 3 should be in the same information set.

# Note: The actual node names (e.g., "stage3_lA", "stage3_lB") are placeholders for illustration.

This code snippet creates a game tree for a three-stage game with imperfect recall using the pygambit library. The game starts with a chance node that decides between two outcomes, L and R, with equal probabilities. In the second stage, Player 1 makes a decision based on the outcome of the chance node. In the third stage, Player 1 makes another decision but without recalling the outcome of the first stage, only remembering her choice from the second stage. This setup requires grouping the third-stage decisions into information sets based on the second-stage choice, reflecting the imperfect recall. The payoffs for all outcomes are set to 0 as specified.
