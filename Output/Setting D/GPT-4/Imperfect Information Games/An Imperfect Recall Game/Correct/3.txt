# Stage 1: Chance node determines L or R with equal probabilities.
# Stage 2: Player 1 observes the outcome of stage 1 and chooses either l or r.
# At this point, Player 1 knows whether L or R occurred in stage 1.
# Stage 3: Player 1 chooses again either A or B, but has forgotten the outcome of stage 1.
# She only remembers her choice in stage 2, not whether L or R occurred.
# Therefore, the information sets in stage 3 need to group nodes based on the action taken in stage 2, not on the outcome of stage 1.

# For each action l or r taken by Player 1 in stage 2, there are two nodes in stage 3 (after choosing A or B).
# These nodes need to be grouped into the same information set because Player 1 has forgotten the outcome of stage 1 (L or R).
# She only knows she chose l or r, but not in response to which chance outcome.

# Grouping nodes for action l in stage 3 into the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
# Grouping nodes for action r in stage 3 into the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)

This code constructs the extensive-form game as described, with a chance node at the beginning, followed by Player 1's decisions with imperfect recall in the third stage. The `set_infoset` function is used to correctly group nodes in the third stage based on Player 1's action in the second stage, reflecting the imperfect recall of the game's history.
