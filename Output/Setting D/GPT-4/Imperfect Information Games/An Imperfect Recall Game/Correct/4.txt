```python
# In stage 3, Player 1 has forgotten the outcome of stage 1 and only knows her own choice in stage 2.
# This means that for each choice in stage 2 (l or r), Player 1's decisions in stage 3 (A or B) cannot be distinguished based on the outcome of stage 1.
# Therefore, we need to group the nodes in stage 3 based on the choice made in stage 2, not on the outcome of stage 1.

# For choice l in stage 2, the nodes corresponding to choosing A or B in stage 3 after L or R in stage 1 should be in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset) # Grouping LA and RA
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset) # Grouping LB and RB

# For choice r in stage 2, the same logic applies.
# However, since the information sets are already created in the previous steps, there's no need to explicitly set them again for choice r.
# The necessary information sets have been defined for Player 1's stage 3 decisions based on their stage 2 choice, not the stage 1 outcome.
