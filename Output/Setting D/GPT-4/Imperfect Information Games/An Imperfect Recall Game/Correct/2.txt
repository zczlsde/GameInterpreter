# Since Player 1 forgets the outcome of stage 1 when making the decision in stage 3,
# we need to group the decision nodes in stage 3 based on Player 1's choice in stage 2, not on the outcome of stage 1.

# For each choice of Player 1 in stage 2 (either l or r), there are two possible histories in stage 3:
# one following L and one following R from stage 1. 
# However, since Player 1 forgets the outcome of stage 1, she cannot distinguish between these histories.
# Therefore, we need to group these nodes into the same information set.

# Assuming g.root.children[0] is the node after choice L in stage 1 and Player 1 chooses l in stage 2,
# and g.root.children[1] is the node after choice R in stage 1 and Player 1 also chooses l in stage 2,
# then g.root.children[0].children[0] and g.root.children[1].children[0] are the nodes for choices A and B in stage 3 after choosing l in stage 2.
# These should be in the same information set.

# Similarly, for choice r in stage 2, g.root.children[0].children[1] and g.root.children[1].children[1] are the nodes for choices A and B in stage 3.
# These should also be in the same information set.
