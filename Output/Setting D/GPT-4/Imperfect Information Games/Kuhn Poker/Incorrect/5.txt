```python
# Since Alice moves first without knowing the allocation of the chance node, 
# all of her decision nodes after the chance node outcomes (JQ, JK, QJ, QK, KJ, KQ) 
# should be in the same information set for the action of checking or betting.
# However, since the game tree branches based on the chance node's outcome, 
# and Alice's decision is the first after each outcome, there's no need to explicitly 
# set an information set for her initial decision as each is unique and follows from a chance node.

# Bob's decision nodes after Alice checks are in different branches based on the chance node's outcome.
# Bob cannot distinguish Alice's card, so his decision nodes after Alice checks should be grouped 
# in the same information set for each possible card Alice could have.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset) # Alice has J, Bob has Q or K
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[3].children[0].infoset) # Alice has Q, Bob has J or K
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[4].children[0], g.root.children[5].children[0].infoset) # Alice has K, Bob has J or Q

# Similarly, Bob's decision nodes after Alice bets are in different branches based on the chance node's outcome.
# Bob cannot distinguish Alice's card, so his decision nodes after Alice bets should be grouped 
# in the same information set for each possible card Alice could have.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset) # Alice has J, Bob has Q or K
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[1], g.root.children[3].children[1].infoset) # Alice has Q, Bob has J or K
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[4].children[1], g.root.children[5].children[1].infoset) # Alice has K, Bob has J or Q

# For Alice's decision to fold or call after Bob bets, it's similar to her initial decision where 
# her decision nodes directly follow a unique path from the chance node and Bob's action, 
# so each decision node is inherently in its own information set due to the sequential nature of the game.
# Therefore, there's no need to group Alice's decision nodes into information sets for the fold or call decision,
# as they are already uniquely determined by the path of play.

This code constructs the extensive-form game for the described three-card poker game between Alice and Bob, including the chance node for card distribution, Alice's and Bob's decision nodes, and the outcomes based on their actions. The information sets for Bob's decisions are set according to the instructions to handle imperfect information, ensuring that Bob's decisions are grouped correctly based on the information available to him.
