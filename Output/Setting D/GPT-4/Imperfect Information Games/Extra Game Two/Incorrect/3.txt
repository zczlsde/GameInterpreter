# However, since the API requires that nodes in the same information set must have the same number of descendants (actions available), and Player 1's second decision does not depend on Player 2's action, we do not group these nodes into the same information set in this step.

# Player 3's decision does not require an information set grouping because Player 3's decision is made with full knowledge of the game history.

```
This code constructs an extensive-form game with three players where Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, leading to imperfect information. The game progresses through four stages with decisions at each stage and outcomes determined by Player 3's final choice. The use of `g.set_infoset` ensures that Player 2's decisions are grouped into the same information set, reflecting the imperfect information scenario.
