```python
# Since Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, all of Player 2's decision nodes are in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[1].infoset)

# For Player 1's second decision, since it occurs after Player 2's decision which Player 1 does not observe, all of Player 1's second decision nodes corresponding to each of Player 2's decisions are in the same information set.
# However, since the game tree structure is not fully detailed in the description, it's assumed that Player 1's decision nodes after Player 2's decision are distinct based on Player 1's initial choice. Thus, there's no need to group Player 1's second decision nodes across different initial choices into the same information set.

# Player 3's decision does not require an information set grouping since there's no indication Player 3 is unaware of the game state by the time they make their decision.
```

To construct the extensive-form game described using the PyGambit library, we'll follow the game stages and player decisions as outlined. The game involves three players and four stages, with decisions at each stage affecting the outcomes. Player 2's decision is made without knowledge of Player 1's choice, indicating imperfect information which we'll handle using information sets. Here's how we can code this scenario:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with three players
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2", "Player 3"],
                      title="Sequential game with imperfect information")

# Stage 1: Player 1's decision
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["A", "B", "C"])

# Stage 2: Player 2's decision without knowing Player 1's choice
# We create moves for each of Player 1's choices, but we'll group them into the same information set later
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["D", "E"])

# Stage 3: Player 1's decision again, after Player 2's choice
# Since Player 1's decision is after Player 2's, and Player 2's decision was without knowing Player 1's initial choice,
# we create new moves for Player 1 under each of Player 2's decisions
for node in g.root.children:
    for child in node.children:
        g.append_move(child, "Player 1", ["F", "G"])

# Stage 4: Player 3's final decision
# Player 3's decision is made after all previous choices, leading to the final outcomes
for node in g.root.children:
    for child in node.children:
        for grandchild in child.children:
            g.append_move(grandchild, "Player 3", ["Q", "W"])

# Set outcomes based on Player 3's decision
for node in g.root.children:
    for child in node.children:
        for grandchild in child.children:
            for great_grandchild in grandchild.children:
                if great_grandchild.move.label == "Q":
                    g.set_outcome(great_grandchild, g.add_outcome([3, 3, 3]))
                elif great_grandchild.move.label == "W":
                    g.set_outcome(great_grandchild, g.add_outcome([2, 2, 3]))

# Handling imperfect information for Player 2's decision
# Since Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, all of Player 2's decision nodes are in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[1].infoset)

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code constructs the game tree as described, with Player 1 making the initial choice among actions A, B, and C. Player 2 then makes a choice without knowing Player 1's action, represented by grouping all of Player 2's decision nodes into the same information set. Player 1 makes another decision, followed by Player 3's final decision, which determines the payoffs for all players. The use of information sets for Player 2's decisions captures the imperfect information aspect of the game.
