# Since Player 2 makes a decision without knowing Player 1's choice, all of Player 2's decision nodes are in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].infoset) # Linking D and E decisions after Player 1 chooses A

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[1].infoset) # Linking D and E decisions after Player 1 chooses C

# Now, we need to group the decision nodes of Player 1 in the third stage, which are based on Player 2's decisions without knowing which action Player 2 took.
# Since Player 1's decision in the third stage depends on Player 2's action, and Player 2's actions are indistinguishable to Player 1, we group them accordingly.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].infoset) # Grouping F and G decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of A
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[1], g.root.children[0].children[1].children[1].infoset) # Ensuring all F and G decisions are grouped after A
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0].infoset) # Grouping F and G decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].infoset) # Ensuring all F and G decisions are grouped after B
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[1].children[0].infoset) # Grouping F and G decisions after Player 2 chooses D or E following Player 1's choice of C
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0].children[1], g.root.children[2].children[1].children[1].infoset) # Ensuring all F and G decisions are grouped after C

# Note: The above code assumes that each child node represents a decision point following the previous player's action.
# For example, g.root.children[0] represents Player 1 choosing A, and g.root.children[0].children[0] represents Player 2 choosing D after Player 1 chose A.
# The set_infoset function groups decision nodes into the same information set when a player cannot distinguish between the situations leading to those nodes.
