# Since the existing manufacturer observes the signal but not the actual strength of the new manufacturer,
# the decision nodes for the existing manufacturer after observing a strong signal (regardless of the actual strength)
# should be grouped in the same information set.
# Similarly, the decision nodes after observing a weak signal should also be grouped in the same information set.

# Let's assume the game tree structure is as follows:
# g.root is the chance node determining the strength of the new manufacturer.
# g.root.children[0] is the node for a strong new manufacturer, and g.root.children[1] is for a weak new manufacturer.
# Each of these nodes then branches into two for the signal given by the new manufacturer, strong or weak.
# So, g.root.children[0].children[0] is strong manufacturer giving a strong signal,
# and g.root.children[0].children[1] is strong manufacturer giving a weak signal.
# Similarly, g.root.children[1].children[0] is weak manufacturer giving a strong signal,
# and g.root.children[1].children[1] is weak manufacturer giving a weak signal.

# The existing manufacturer's decision nodes after a strong signal are:
# - g.root.children[0].children[0] (Strong manufacturer, strong signal)
# - g.root.children[1].children[0] (Weak manufacturer, strong signal)
# These should be in the same information set because the existing manufacturer cannot distinguish between these scenarios based on the signal alone.

# The existing manufacturer's decision nodes after a weak signal are:
# - g.root.children[0].children[1] (Strong manufacturer, weak signal)
# - g.root.children[1].children[1] (Weak manufacturer, weak signal)
# These should also be in the same information set for the same reason.

# Setting the information sets accordingly:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)
