# Since both players choose their actions simultaneously, we model this as a sequential game where one player (say Player 1) moves first without knowing the other's choice, and then Player 2 moves. However, since their moves are actually simultaneous, Player 1 does not know Player 2's move when making their decision. This is represented by grouping Player 1's decision nodes under different Player 2's actions into the same information set.

# Assuming Player 1 is represented as choosing between Rock, Paper, or Scissors first, and then Player 2 chooses among the same options. We model the game as if Player 2 moves after Player 1, but Player 2's decision nodes, based on Player 1's actions, are in the same information set because Player 2 does not know Player 1's action when choosing.

# For Player 1, there are no information sets to define because Player 1 moves first without any prior moves. 

# For Player 2, we need to group the decision nodes following each of Player 1's actions (Rock, Paper, Scissors) into the same information set because Player 2 chooses without knowing Player 1's choice.

# Let's assume the game tree is constructed in a way that g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1], and g.root.children[2] correspond to Player 1's choice of Rock, Paper, and Scissors respectively. Each of these nodes then branches into three more nodes for Player 2's choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors) in response to Player 1's action.

# Therefore, we need to set the information set for Player 2's decision nodes following each of Player 1's actions to indicate that Player 2's decision is made without knowledge of Player 1's choice.

# Grouping Player 2's decision nodes following Player 1's choice of Rock into the same information set.
