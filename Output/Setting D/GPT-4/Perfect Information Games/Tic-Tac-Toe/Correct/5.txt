# Since all moves by "x" and "o" are visible to both players, there's no traditional imperfect information in terms of hidden actions or private information.
# However, the game tree's structure implies that decisions are made with full knowledge of the past moves.
# Therefore, there's no need to group nodes into information sets based on hidden information, as all information is shared and visible.
# In this specific scenario, every move leads to a distinct game state that both players can observe.
# Thus, there are no nodes for "x" or "o" that need to be grouped into the same information set due to imperfect information.
# The game is a perfect information game, and the concept of information sets to represent imperfect information does not apply here.
