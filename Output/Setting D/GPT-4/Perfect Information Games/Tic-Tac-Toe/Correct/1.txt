# Since "x" and "o" take turns and the game evolves based on their decisions, 
# each decision point for "o" after "x" makes a move is an information set for "o", 
# and vice versa, because each player knows the state of the game when making their decision.

# However, in this specific scenario, we are only focusing on the next move by "x" and the subsequent moves by "o".
# "x" has three possible moves: (0, 0), (0, 2), and (1, 0). 
# After "x" chooses, "o" has to decide without knowing the outcome of "x"'s choice, 
# but since "o"'s moves directly follow "x"'s, and the game state is fully observable, 
# "o" will know where "x" placed their mark. Thus, each of "o"'s decision nodes is unique and does not require grouping into information sets based on "x"'s actions.

# However, for the sake of illustrating the use of set_infoset in a situation where it might be needed:
# If there were a scenario where "o" had to make a decision without knowing "x"'s exact move (which is not the case here given the game's sequential and fully observable nature), 
# we would group "o"'s decision nodes following each of "x"'s possible moves into information sets if "o" couldn't observe "x"'s move.

# In this game, since "o" observes "x"'s move before making their own, there's no need to group "o"'s decision nodes into information sets based on imperfect information.
# Similarly, "x"'s decision nodes do not require grouping into information sets for the same reason.

# Therefore, in this specific game description, there's no need to use set_infoset() to group nodes into information sets based on the provided game dynamics.
