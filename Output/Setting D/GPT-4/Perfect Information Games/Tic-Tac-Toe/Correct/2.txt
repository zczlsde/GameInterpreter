```python
# Since "x" and "o" take turns and the game tree branches based on their moves, 
# there's no simultaneous move situation here, thus no traditional imperfect information 
# in the sense of not knowing the opponent's move at the time of making one's own move.
# However, if we consider the perspective of an external observer who does not see the moves being made,
# every move by "x" or "o" could be considered as creating a new information set for the observer,
# but this does not apply to the players themselves in the context of this game's rules.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this game's representation as described.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players: "X" and "O"
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["X", "O"], title="Tic-Tac-Toe")

# The root node is the current board state:
# e | o | e
# e | x | o
# x | x | o
# "X" moves first and has three options for placing a mark: (0, 0), (0, 2), and (1, 0).

# Append moves for "X" at the root node
g.append_move(g.root, "X", ["(0, 0)", "(0, 2)", "(1, 0)"])

# If "X" places the mark on (0, 0)
# "O" can then place the mark on (0, 2) and (1, 0).
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "O", ["(0, 2)", "(1, 0)"])
# If "O" places the mark on (0, 2), "O" wins.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="O wins"))
# If "O" places the mark on (1, 0), "X" can then place the mark on (0, 2), and "X" wins.
