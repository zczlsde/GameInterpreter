```python
# Since all actions are observable and there's no simultaneous move or hidden information after any move,
# there's no need to group any decision nodes into the same information set based on the game's description.
# Each move is based on the complete information of the previous state of the game.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this game representation.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players: Alice and Bob
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alice", "Bob"], title="Coin Piles Game")

# Alice's first move: choose to "take" or "push" the piles
g.append_move(g.root, "Alice", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Alice takes, the game ends. Alice gets 4, Bob gets 1
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0], g.add_outcome([4, 1], label="Alice takes"))

# If Alice pushes, the piles double and it's Bob's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Bob", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Bob takes after the first push, he gets 8, Alice gets 2
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 8], label="Bob takes after first push"))

# If Bob pushes, the piles double again and it's Alice's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1], "Alice", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Alice takes after the second push, she gets 16, Bob gets 4
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([16, 4], label="Alice takes after second push"))

# If Alice pushes, the piles double again and it's Bob's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1], "Bob", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Bob takes after the second push, he gets 32, Alice gets 8
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([8, 32], label="Bob takes after second push"))

# If Bob pushes for the final time, the piles double, and the game ends with Alice getting the larger pile
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([64, 16], label="Final push"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the scenario with Alice and Bob and their decisions to take or push piles of coins. The game tree is built step by step, reflecting each player's choices and the consequences of those choices, including the doubling of the piles when pushed. The outcomes are set based on the game's rules, with payoffs corresponding to the number of coins each player ends up with, depending on their actions and the actions of their opponent.
