# Since all actions are visible to both players and there's no hidden information or simultaneous moves,
# there's no need to group any nodes into the same information set based on the game's description.
# Each move is made with full knowledge of the previous moves, and there are no simultaneous or hidden actions.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this game.

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Alice and Bob
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alice", "Bob"], title="Coin Piles Game")

# Initial move by Alice: she can either take the piles or push them
g.append_move(g.root, "Alice", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Alice takes, the game ends. Payoffs: Alice 4, Bob 1 (since Alice takes the larger pile)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0], g.add_outcome([4, 1], label="Alice takes"))

# If Alice pushes, the piles double and it's Bob's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Bob", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Bob takes after the first push, payoffs: Bob 8, Alice 2
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 8], label="Bob takes after first push"))

# If Bob pushes, the piles double again and it's Alice's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1], "Alice", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Alice takes after the second push, payoffs: Alice 16, Bob 4
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([16, 4], label="Alice takes after second push"))

# If Alice pushes for the second time, the piles double for the last time and it's Bob's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1], "Bob", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Bob takes after the second push by Alice, payoffs: Bob 32, Alice 8
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([8, 32], label="Bob takes after second push by Alice"))

# If Bob pushes for the last time, the game ends. Alice gets the larger pile since it's the end of the game.
# Note: The last push also doubles the piles, so Alice gets 64 and Bob gets 16.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([64, 16], label="End of game"))
