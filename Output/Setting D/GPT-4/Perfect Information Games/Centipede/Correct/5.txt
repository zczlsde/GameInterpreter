```python
# Since all actions are observable and there's no simultaneous move or hidden information after any move,
# there's no need to group any decision nodes into the same information set based on the game description provided.
# Each move is based on the full knowledge of the previous state of the game, meaning there's perfect information at each decision point.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this game representation.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players: Alice and Bob
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Alice", "Bob"], title="Coin Piles Game")

# Alice's first move: choose to "take" or "push" the initial piles of 4 and 1 coins
g.append_move(g.root, "Alice", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Alice takes, the game ends. Alice gets 4, Bob gets 1.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0], g.add_outcome([4, 1], label="Alice takes"))

# If Alice pushes, the piles double and it's Bob's turn with piles of 2 and 8 coins
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Bob", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Bob takes after Alice pushes, he gets 8, Alice gets 2.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 8], label="Bob takes after push"))

# If Bob also pushes, the piles double again to 4 and 16, and it's Alice's turn
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1], "Alice", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Alice takes now, she gets 16, Bob gets 4.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([16, 4], label="Alice takes after pushes"))

# If Alice pushes again, the piles double to 8 and 32, and it's Bob's final move
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1], "Bob", ["Take", "Push"])

# If Bob takes, he gets 32, Alice gets 8.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([8, 32], label="Bob takes final"))

# If Bob pushes for the final time, the piles double to 16 and 64, and the game ends with Alice taking the larger pile
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([64, 16], label="Final push"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the scenario with Alice and Bob and their decisions regarding the piles of coins. Each decision point (node) in the game tree corresponds to a player's choice to either "take" the current piles or "push" them to the other player, with the piles doubling in size each time they are pushed. The game is constructed with perfect information, as each player's move is fully observable by the other player, and there are no simultaneous moves or hidden information. Therefore, there's no need to group any decision nodes into the same information set, and the `set_infoset()` function is not used in this game representation.
