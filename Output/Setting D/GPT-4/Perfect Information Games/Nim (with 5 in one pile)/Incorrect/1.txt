```python
# Since Alice and Bob take turns and each has the same set of actions (1 or 2 stones) at each decision point,
# the game has perfect information at each decision node. Each player knows exactly how many stones are left
# and can make an informed decision based on that. Therefore, there's no need to group any nodes into the same
# information set based on the game's description. Each decision node is distinct and known to the player making
# the decision, so there's no imperfect information to represent with set_infoset() in this game.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players: Alice and Bob

# Alice moves first with the choice to take 1 or 2 stones from the pile of 5 stones
g.append_move(g.root, "Alice", ["Take 1", "Take 2"])

# If Alice takes 1 stone, leaving 4 stones, Bob can take 1 or 2 stones
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Bob", ["Take 1", "Take 2"])

# If Bob takes 1 stone, leaving 3 stones, Alice can take 1 or 2 stones

This code constructs an extensive-form game representation of the "Avoid the Last Stone" game using the pygambit library. The game is structured as a sequential game where Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 2 stones from a pile initially containing 5 stones. The goal is to force the opponent to take the last stone, resulting in a loss for them and a win for the player who avoided taking the last stone. The game tree is explicitly defined for each possible action and its resulting state, with outcomes assigned based on who is forced to take the last stone.
