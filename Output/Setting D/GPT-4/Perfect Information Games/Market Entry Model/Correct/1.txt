```python
# Since Firm 2's decision to enter or out is the first move and directly affects the game's continuation, 
# there's no need for an information set for Firm 2's initial decision as it's a perfect information move.

# After Firm 2 decides to enter, Firm 1 must decide how to compete: either Fight or Accommodate.
# This decision is made with perfect information regarding Firm 2's entry, so there's no need for an information set here either.

# The game described does not involve simultaneous moves or hidden information after the initial move,
# hence there are no information sets required to group decision nodes based on the game's description.

# No set_infoset() function is necessary for this game structure as described.
```

Given the game description, we can construct the extensive form game using the PyGambit library. The game involves two firms, where Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or not, and if it enters, Firm 1 decides how to respond (Fight or Accommodate). The payoffs are structured based on the conditions provided. Here's how you can code this scenario:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game with two players: Firm 1 and Firm 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Firm 1", "Firm 2"], title="Market Entry Game")

# Firm 2 decides whether to enter the market or stay out
g.append_move(g.root, "Firm 2", ["Enter", "Out"])

# If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 decides how to compete: Fight or Accommodate
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Firm 1", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])

# Define payoffs based on the conditions provided:
# 1. Firm 1 earns more if Firm 2 does not enter.
# 2. If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 and Firm 2 earn the same amount if Firm 1 accommodates.
# 3. If Firm 2 enters, Firm 2 earns more than Firm 1 if Firm 1 fights.

# Assuming specific payoff values that satisfy the above conditions:
# If Firm 2 stays out, Firm 1 gets a higher payoff, and Firm 2 gets 0 (since it doesn't enter)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], g.add_outcome([3, 0], label="Firm 2 Stays Out"))

# If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 fights, Firm 2 earns more than Firm 1
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Firm 1 Fights"))

# If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 accommodates, both earn the same but less than if Firm 2 stays out
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([2, 2], label="Firm 1 Accommodates"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code snippet creates an extensive-form game where Firm 2's decision to enter or not is the first move, followed by Firm 1's decision on how to compete if Firm 2 enters. The payoffs are set according to the conditions provided, ensuring that the strategic interactions and outcomes reflect the game's description accurately.
