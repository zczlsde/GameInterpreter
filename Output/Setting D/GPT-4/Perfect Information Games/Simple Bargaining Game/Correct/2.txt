```python
# Since the game is sequential and each player's move is clearly observed by the other, 
# there's no need to group any decision nodes into the same information set based on the game's description.
# Each decision is made with full knowledge of the previous actions, thus there are no simultaneous moves or hidden actions.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this game scenario.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with two players, A and B
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["A", "B"], title="Negotiation Game")

# A proposes the first distribution plan: A gets 5500, B gets 4500
# This is the only action at this stage, so we directly move to B's decision
g.append_move(g.root, "A", ["Propose 5500-4500"])

# B decides whether to accept A's first proposal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "B", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If B accepts, the game ends with the proposed distribution
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([5500, 4500], label="B Accepts Initial"))

# If B rejects, B proposes an equal split
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "B", ["Propose 5000-5000"])

# A decides whether to accept B's counterproposal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], "A", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If A accepts B's proposal, the game ends with a slightly adjusted payoff due to negotiation costs
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([4750, 4750], label="A Accepts Counter"))

# If A rejects B's proposal, A proposes a new plan with no right for B to reject
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1], "A", ["Propose 5200-4800"])

# B has to accept A's final proposal, leading to a different adjusted payoff
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([4693, 4332], label="Final Agreement"))

# Save the EFG

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the negotiation process between players A and B over the division of 10,000 pounds. The game is sequential, starting with A's proposal, followed by B's decision to accept or reject. If B rejects, the game moves to B's counterproposal, followed by A's decision. If A rejects B's counterproposal, A makes a final proposal that B must accept. The payoffs at each terminal node represent the final amounts received by A and B, reflecting the outcomes of their decisions throughout the negotiation.
