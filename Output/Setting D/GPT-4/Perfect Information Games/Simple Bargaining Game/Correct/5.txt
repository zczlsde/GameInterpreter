```python
# Since the game described does not involve simultaneous moves or hidden information from the perspective of decision-making (each player knows the state of the game when making their decisions), 
# there is no need to group any nodes into the same information set based on the given game description.
# Each decision is made with full knowledge of the previous actions, and there are no simultaneous or hidden actions that would require the use of information sets to represent imperfect information.
# Therefore, no set_infoset() function is necessary for this game structure.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game tree with players A and B
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["A", "B"], title="Negotiation Game")

# A proposes the first distribution plan: A gets 5500, B gets 4500
g.append_move(g.root, "A", ["Propose 5500-4500"])

# B decides whether to accept or reject A's first proposal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "B", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If B accepts, the game ends with the proposed distribution
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([5500, 4500], label="B Accepts Initial Proposal"))

# If B rejects, B proposes an equal split
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "B", ["Propose 5000-5000"])

# A decides whether to accept or reject B's equal split proposal
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], "A", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If A accepts B's proposal, the game ends with the equal split adjusted to 4750 each due to negotiation costs
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([4750, 4750], label="A Accepts Equal Split"))

# If A rejects B's proposal, A proposes a new plan where A gets 5200 and B gets 4800
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1], "A", ["Propose 5200-4800"])

# B has no right to reject and must accept, ending the game with A receiving 4693 and B receiving 4332
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([4693, 4332], label="Final Proposal Accepted"))

# Save the EFG

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the negotiation process between players A and B over the division of 10,000 pounds. The game progresses through a series of proposals, with each player having the opportunity to accept or reject the current proposal. The final amounts received by each player are determined by the sequence of accept/reject decisions made throughout the game.
