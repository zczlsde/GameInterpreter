```python
# Since Country B moves first by choosing to "Accept" or "Rebel", there's no need for an information set for Country B's initial move.
# However, after Country B decides to "Rebel", Country A's decision to "Grant Independence" or try to "Suppress" leads to a chance node (nature's move) determining the outcome of the war.
# The outcomes of the war (Country B winning or losing) are not directly decided by Country A but are a result of a chance move.
# Therefore, there's no decision for Country A after deciding to "Suppress" where Country A would not know the outcome, as the outcome is determined by chance, not Country A's decision.
# Hence, there are no nodes for Country A's decisions that need to be grouped in the same information set based on the given game structure.
# All decisions are made with perfect information about the previous moves, except for the outcome of the war, which is a chance move and does not involve a decision by Country A or Country B that would require an information set.
