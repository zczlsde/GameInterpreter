```python
# Since Country B moves first by choosing to "Accept" or "Rebel", and Country A responds to Country B's actions, 
# there's no need for information sets based on Country B's initial decision as these are perfectly observable moves.

# However, when considering the event of a war, which is a move by nature (a chance move), 
# the outcome of the war is uncertain to both players until it happens. 
# This introduces imperfect information regarding the war outcome. 
# But since the war outcome is a chance move and not a decision by Country A or Country B, 
# and it directly leads to terminal nodes without further decisions, 
# there's no decision node for either player that requires grouping into information sets based on the war's outcome.

# Therefore, in this specific game description, there are no player decision nodes that require grouping into the same information set 
# based on the players not knowing which node they are at, as all decisions are made with perfect information of the prior moves,
# and the only chance move (nature's move) leads directly to terminal outcomes without further decisions.

# In summary, this game does not require the use of set_infoset() functions based on the given description and the nature of decisions and outcomes.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Country A and Country B
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Country A", "Country B"], title="Diplomacy Game")

# Country B decides to "Accept" the status quo or "Rebel"
g.append_move(g.root, "Country B", ["Accept", "Rebel"])

# If Country B accepts, Country A can choose to "Tax" or "Drop Taxes"
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Country A", ["Tax", "Drop Taxes"])
# Set outcomes for Country A's decisions after Country B accepts
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([6, -2], label="Tax"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([4, 0], label="Drop Taxes"))

# If Country B rebels, Country A can choose to "Grant Independence" or "Suppress"
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Country A", ["Grant Independence", "Suppress"])
# Set outcome for granting independence
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 3], label="Grant Independence"))

# For "Suppress", introduce a chance move to determine the outcome of the war
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.players.chance, ["B Wins", "B Loses"])
# Set the probabilities for the outcomes of the war
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset, [gbt.Rational(3, 10), gbt.Rational(7, 10)])

# Set outcomes for the war
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([-1, -3], label="B Wins War"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([-1, -5], label="B Loses War"))

# Save the EFG

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the scenario between Country A and Country B using the pygambit library. The game starts with Country B's decision to either accept the status quo or rebel. Depending on Country B's choice, Country A then makes decisions that lead to various outcomes, including a chance move representing the uncertain outcome of a war if Country B rebels and Country A chooses to suppress the rebellion. The probabilities of winning or losing the war for Country B are set according to the game description.
