```python
# Since Country B moves first by choosing to "Accept" or "Rebel", and then Country A responds to Country B's action, 
# there's no need for information sets based on Country B's initial decision as these are perfectly observable moves.

# However, when Country B rebels leading to a war, the outcome of the war is determined by a move of nature (chance node) 
# with probabilities for winning or losing the war. This introduces imperfect information for subsequent decisions, 
# but since the outcome directly leads to terminal nodes with no further decisions, there's no player decision after the chance node 
# that would require grouping nodes into information sets based on the uncertainty of the war outcome.

# Therefore, in this specific game description, there are no player decisions after a chance node that would necessitate 
# the use of information sets to group decision nodes under imperfect information. Each decision by Country A in response 
# to Country B's actions (Accept or Rebel) is made with perfect information about those actions.

# In summary, this game structure does not require the use of set_infoset() functions based on the provided description, 
# as there are no decisions made under imperfect information that would require grouping nodes into the same information set.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Country A and Country B
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Country A", "Country B"], title="Status Quo and Rebellion Game")

# Country B decides to "Accept" the status quo or "Rebel"
g.append_move(g.root, "Country B", ["Accept", "Rebel"])

# If Country B accepts, Country A can choose to "Tax" or "Drop Taxes"
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Country A", ["Tax", "Drop Taxes"])
# Set outcomes for Country A's decision after Country B accepts
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([6, -2], label="Tax"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([4, 0], label="Drop Taxes"))

# If Country B rebels, Country A can choose to "Grant Independence" or "Suppress"
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Country A", ["Grant Independence", "Suppress"])
# Set outcome for granting independence
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 3], label="Grant Independence"))

# For suppression, a chance node determines the outcome of the war
g.append_move(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.players.chance, ["B Wins", "B Loses"])
# Set probabilities for the outcomes of the war
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset, [gbt.Rational(3, 10), gbt.Rational(7, 10)])
# Set outcomes for the war
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([-1, -3], label="B Wins War"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([-1, -5], label="B Loses War"))

This code snippet constructs an extensive-form game representing the strategic interactions between Country A and Country B, including decisions on accepting the status quo, rebelling, taxing, dropping taxes, granting independence, and suppressing a rebellion. The game also incorporates a chance move to determine the outcome of a war, with specified probabilities for winning or losing.
