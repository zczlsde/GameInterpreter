# 2. Append the initial move for Alice with actions Take or Push.
# 3. Append the move for Bob after Alice's move.
# 4. Append the move for Alice after Bob's move.
# 5. Set information sets for the nodes where Alice has to make a decision.
# 6. Group Alice's decision nodes based on her available actions (Take or Push) to represent the imperfect information in the game.
