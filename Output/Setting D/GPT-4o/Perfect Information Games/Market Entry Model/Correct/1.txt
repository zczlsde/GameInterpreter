```python
# Step 1: Firm 2 decides whether to enter or stay out. This is Firm 2's decision node.
# Step 2: If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 decides whether to Fight or Accommodate. 
# Firm 1's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Enter) and g.root.children[1] (Out).
# Step 3: Since Firm 1's decision is contingent on Firm 2 entering, and Firm 1 knows if Firm 2 has entered, 
# there is no imperfect information for Firm 1. Therefore, no information set is needed for Firm 1.
# In this game, there is no simultaneous move or hidden information that requires an information set.

# No set_infoset() function is needed because there is no imperfect information in this sequential game.
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Firm 1 and Firm 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Firm 1", "Firm 2"], title="Entry Deterrence Game")

# Step 1: Firm 2 decides whether to enter or stay out. This is Firm 2's decision node.
g.append_move(g.root, "Firm 2", ["Enter", "Out"])

# Step 2: If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 decides whether to Fight or Accommodate.
# Firm 1's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Enter) and g.root.children[1] (Out).
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Firm 1", ["Fight", "Accommodate"])

# Step 3: Set the payoffs according to the conditions given in the problem statement.
# Firm 1 earns more if Firm 2 does not enter.
# If Firm 2 enters, Firm 1 and Firm 2 earn the same amount if Firm 1 accommodates.
# If Firm 2 enters, Firm 2 earns more than firm 1 if Firm 1 fights.

# Payoffs for the outcomes
# Outcome when Firm 2 chooses "Out"
outcome_out = g.add_outcome([3, 0], label="Firm 2 Out")
# Outcome when Firm 2 chooses "Enter" and Firm 1 chooses "Fight"
outcome_fight = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Firm 2 Enters, Firm 1 Fights")
# Outcome when Firm 2 chooses "Enter" and Firm 1 chooses "Accommodate"
outcome_accommodate = g.add_outcome([2, 2], label="Firm 2 Enters, Firm 1 Accommodates")

# Set the outcomes for each terminal node
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1], outcome_out)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], outcome_fight)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], outcome_accommodate)

# No set_infoset() function is needed because there is no imperfect information in this sequential game.
