# Thought process:
# 1. The game starts with Player A proposing a distribution plan.
# 2. Player B has the choice to accept or reject A's proposal.
# 3. If B rejects, B proposes an equal split.
# 4. Player A then has the choice to accept or reject B's proposal.
# 5. If A rejects, A proposes a new plan which B must accept.
# 6. There is no simultaneous move or hidden information in this game.
# 7. Therefore, there are no information sets to be set in this game.
