```python
# Step 1: Identify the decision nodes and the sequence of moves.
# A proposes a distribution plan first, and B decides to accept or reject.
# If B rejects, B proposes an equal split, and A decides to accept or reject.
# If A rejects, A proposes a new plan, which B must accept.

# Step 2: Determine the imperfect information.
# In this game, there is no simultaneous move or hidden information.
# Each player knows the previous actions taken by the other player.
# Therefore, there are no information sets needed for imperfect information.

# Since there is no imperfect information in this game, no set_infoset() function is needed.

# Step 1: A proposes a distribution plan where A gets 5500 and B gets 4500
g.append_move(g.root, "A", ["Propose 5500/4500"])

# Step 2: B decides to accept or reject A's proposal

# Step 5: A decides to accept or reject B's proposal
