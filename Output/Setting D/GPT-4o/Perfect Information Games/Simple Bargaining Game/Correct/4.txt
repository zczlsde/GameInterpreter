# Thought process:
# 1. The game starts with A proposing a distribution plan where A gets 5500 and B gets 4500.
# 2. B has the option to accept or reject A's proposal.
# 3. If B rejects, B proposes an equal split of 5000 each.
# 4. A then has the option to accept or reject B's proposal.
# 5. If A rejects, A proposes a new plan where A gets 5200 and B gets 4800, which B must accept.
# 6. There is no simultaneous move or hidden information in this game, as each player knows the previous actions.
# 7. Therefore, there are no information sets to be set in this game.

# No set_infoset() function is needed as there is no imperfect information in this game.
