```python
# Thought process:
# 1. Alice moves first and has two actions: "take" or "push".
# 2. If Alice "pushes", Bob then has two actions: "take" or "push".
# 3. If Bob "pushes", Alice again has two actions: "take" or "push".
# 4. If Alice "pushes" again, Bob has the final two actions: "take" or "push".
# 5. Since all actions are observable, there is no imperfect information in this game.
# 6. Therefore, no information sets need to be set for this game.
