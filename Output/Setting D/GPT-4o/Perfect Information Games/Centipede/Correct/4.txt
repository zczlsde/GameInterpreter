```python
# Thought process:
# 1. Alice moves first and has two actions: "take" or "push".
# 2. If Alice "pushes", Bob then has two actions: "take" or "push".
# 3. If Bob "pushes", Alice again has two actions: "take" or "push".
# 4. If Alice "pushes" again, Bob has the final two actions: "take" or "push".
# 5. All actions are observable, meaning there is no imperfect information in this game.
# 6. Since all actions are observable, there are no information sets to be set for this game.
