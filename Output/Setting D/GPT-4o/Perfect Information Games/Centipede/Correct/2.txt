```python
# Thought process:
# 1. Alice moves first and has two actions: "take" or "push". 
# 2. If Alice chooses "push", Bob then has the same two actions: "take" or "push".
# 3. If Bob chooses "push", Alice again has the same two actions: "take" or "push".
# 4. If Alice chooses "push" again, Bob has the final decision to "take" or "push".
# 5. Since all actions are observable, there is no imperfect information in this game.
# 6. Therefore, no information sets need to be set for this game.

# No set_infoset() function is needed because all actions are observable and there is no imperfect information.
