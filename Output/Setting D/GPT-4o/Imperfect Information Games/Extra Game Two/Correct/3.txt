# Thought process:
# 1. Player 1 moves first with options A, B, and C.
# 2. Player 2 moves second without knowing Player 1's choice, so Player 2's decision nodes for each of Player 1's actions (A, B, C) should be in the same information set.
# 3. Player 1 moves again after observing Player 2's choice, so Player 1's decision nodes for each of Player 2's actions (D, E) should be in separate information sets for each initial action (A, B, C).
# 4. Player 3 moves last, and their decision is not affected by previous actions, so no information set is needed for Player 3.

# Set the information set for Player 2's decision nodes, as Player 2 does not know Player 1's initial choice.
