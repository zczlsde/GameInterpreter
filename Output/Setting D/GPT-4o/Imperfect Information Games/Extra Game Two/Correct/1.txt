# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. Player 1 makes the first move with three options: A, B, and C.
# 2. Player 2 moves next, without knowing Player 1's choice, and can choose either D or E.
#    This means Player 2's decision nodes after Player 1's choices A, B, and C should be in the same information set.
# 3. Player 1 moves again after observing Player 2's choice, with options F or G.
# 4. Finally, Player 3 makes a decision between Q and W.

# Group Player 2's decision nodes into the same information set because Player 2 does not know Player 1's choice.
