# Step 1: Since Alexis and Beverley make their decisions simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# Step 2: To model the game with a sequential structure, assume Alexis moves first and Beverley moves second.
# Step 3: The starting node, g.root, is Alexis's decision node.
# Step 4: Alexis has two actions, Bach and Stravinsky. So, Beverley's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Alexis's actions Bach and Stravinsky.
# Step 5: Beverley, moving simultaneously, does not know which action Alexis has taken.
# Step 6: Therefore, Beverley's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
