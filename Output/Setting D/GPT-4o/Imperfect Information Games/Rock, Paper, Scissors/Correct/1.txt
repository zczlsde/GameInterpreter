# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. In this game, both players choose their actions (rock, paper, or scissors) simultaneously.
# 2. This means that neither player knows the action chosen by the other player at the time of their decision.
# 3. To represent this in a sequential game structure, we can assume one player moves first, but the other player does not know this move.
# 4. Let's assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.
# 5. Player 2's decision nodes will be based on Player 1's actions (rock, paper, or scissors).
# 6. Since Player 2 does not know Player 1's action, all of Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming g is the game object and g.root is the starting node:
# Player 1's actions are "rock", "paper", "scissors", leading to Player 2's decision nodes.
# These nodes are g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1], and g.root.children[2].

# Group all of Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set because Player 2 does not know Player 1's action.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2], g.root.children[1].infoset)
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new game with two players, Player 1 and Player 2.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2"], title="Rock-Paper-Scissors with Imperfect Information")

# Step 2: Player 1 makes the first move, choosing between "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["rock", "paper", "scissors"])

# Step 3: Player 2 makes a move without knowing Player 1's choice. 
# Player 2's decision nodes are based on Player 1's actions.
# These nodes are g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1], and g.root.children[2].
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Player 2", ["rock", "paper", "scissors"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Player 2", ["rock", "paper", "scissors"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[2], "Player 2", ["rock", "paper", "scissors"])

# Step 4: Group all of Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set because Player 2 does not know Player 1's action.
# This is the code block provided for setting the information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the outcomes for each combination of actions.
# Rock vs Scissors: Player 1 wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[2], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Player 1 wins"))
# Scissors vs Rock: Player 2 wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Player 2 wins"))
# Paper vs Rock: Player 1 wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Player 1 wins"))
# Rock vs Paper: Player 2 wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Player 2 wins"))
# Scissors vs Paper: Player 1 wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[2].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Player 1 wins"))
# Paper vs Scissors: Player 2 wins
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[2], g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Player 2 wins"))
# Rock vs Rock, Paper vs Paper, Scissors vs Scissors: Draw
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Draw"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Draw"))
