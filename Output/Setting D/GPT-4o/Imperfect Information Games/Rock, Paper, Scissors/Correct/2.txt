# Step-by-step thought process:

# In this game, both players choose their actions simultaneously, which means they do not know the other player's choice at the time of making their own choice.
# To represent this in a sequential game structure, we can assume one player moves first, and the other player moves second.
# However, since they move simultaneously, the second player does not know the first player's action, creating imperfect information.

# Let's assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.
# Player 1 has three possible actions: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
# Player 2 also has three possible actions: Rock, Paper, Scissors.

# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1], and g.root.children[2], corresponding to Player 1's actions Rock, Paper, and Scissors, respectively.
# Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between Player 1's actions when making their decision, all of Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2], g.root.children[1].infoset)
