# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. In this game, both players choose their actions (rock, paper, or scissors) simultaneously.
# 2. This means that neither player knows the action of the other player when making their decision.
# 3. To represent this in a sequential game structure, we can assume one player moves first, but the other player does not know this move.
# 4. Let's assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.
# 5. Player 2's decision nodes will be based on Player 1's actions (rock, paper, scissors).
# 6. Since Player 2 does not know Player 1's action, all of Player 2's decision nodes should be in the same information set.

# Assuming g is the game object and g.root is the starting node:
# Player 1's actions are at g.root.children[0] (rock), g.root.children[1] (paper), g.root.children[2] (scissors).
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0], g.root.children[2].children[0].

# Group all of Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
```

import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Player 1 and Player 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2"], title="Rock-Paper-Scissors with Imperfect Information")

# Step 1: Player 1 makes a move first, choosing between Rock, Paper, or Scissors
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"])

# Step 2: Player 2 makes a move, but does not know Player 1's choice
# We will append moves for Player 2 at each of Player 1's decision nodes
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Player 2", ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Player 2", ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[2], "Player 2", ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"])

# Step 3: Set the information set for Player 2's decision nodes
# Since Player 2 does not know Player 1's action, all of Player 2's decision nodes should be in the same information set
# Use the provided code block to set the information set

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)

# Step 4: Define the outcomes based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors
# Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock
# If both players choose the same action, it's a draw

# Outcomes for Player 1 choosing Rock
