# Step 1: Player 1, the leader, makes the first move by choosing either "S" or "C".
# Step 2: Player 2, the follower, tries to interpret Player 1's choice. However, there is a small probability of misinterpretation.
# Step 3: Player 2 makes a decision based on their perception of Player 1's choice.
# Step 4: Since Player 2 might misinterpret Player 1's choice, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming Player 1 chooses "S", Player 2 perceives it as "S" with 99% probability and as "C" with 1% probability.
# Assuming Player 1 chooses "C", Player 2 perceives it as "C" with 99% probability and as "S" with 1% probability.

# Player 2's decision nodes based on perception:
# - If Player 1 chooses "S", Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0].children[0] (perceived "S") and g.root.children[0].children[1] (perceived "C").
# - If Player 1 chooses "C", Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[1].children[0] (perceived "S") and g.root.children[1].children[1] (perceived "C").

# Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between the actual choice of Player 1 due to misinterpretation, 
# Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
