# Step 1: Player 1 makes a choice between "S" and "C".
# Step 2: Player 2 perceives Player 1's choice, but there is a chance of misinterpretation.
# Step 3: Player 2 makes a decision based on their perception of Player 1's choice.

# Since Player 2 might misinterpret Player 1's choice, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
# This is because Player 2 cannot distinguish between the actual choice of Player 1 due to the misinterpretation probability.

# Assuming the game tree is structured such that:
# g.root.children[0] corresponds to Player 1 choosing "S"
# g.root.children[1] corresponds to Player 1 choosing "C"

# Player 2's decision nodes after perceiving "S" or "C" (with possible misinterpretation) are:
# g.root.children[0].children[0] (perceived "S" after Player 1 chose "S")
# g.root.children[0].children[1] (perceived "C" after Player 1 chose "S")
# g.root.children[1].children[0] (perceived "S" after Player 1 chose "C")
# g.root.children[1].children[1] (perceived "C" after Player 1 chose "C")

# Group Player 2's decision nodes into the same information set due to the misinterpretation probability.
