Given the complexity and depth of the game described, the EFG representation will be quite extensive. Here's a simplified version of the EFG representation for the game between Alice and Bob, focusing on the structure rather than detailing every possible outcome for brevity. This example will illustrate the initial chance node, decisions by Alice and Bob, and a few terminal nodes to demonstrate the format. For a complete game representation, each path described would need to be fully expanded with all possible outcomes.

```
EFG 2 R "Three-card game between Alice and Bob" { "Alice" "Bob" }
c "" 1 "" { "JQ" 1/6 "JK" 1/6 "QJ" 1/6 "QK" 1/6 "KJ" 1/6 "KQ" 1/6 } 0
    p "" 1 1 "" { "Check" "Bet" } 0
        p "" 2 1 "" { "Check" "Bet" } 0
            t "" 1 "Higher card wins 1" { 1, -1 }
            t "" 2 "Higher card wins 1" { -1, 1 }
            p "" 1 2 "" { "Fold" "Call" } 0
                t "" 3 "Bob wins 1" { -1, 1 }
                t "" 4 "Higher card wins 2" { 2, -2 }
                t "" 5 "Higher card wins 2" { -2, 2 }
        p "" 2 2 "" { "Fold" "Call" } 0
            t "" 6 "Alice wins 1" { 1, -1 }
            t "" 7 "Higher card wins 2" { 2, -2 }
            t "" 8 "Higher card wins 2" { -2, 2 }
```

This representation starts with a chance node representing the deal of the cards, followed by Alice's decision node to check or bet. Depending on Alice's action, Bob then decides to check, bet, fold, or call, leading to various terminal nodes representing the outcomes of the game. Each terminal node specifies the payoffs to Alice and Bob, with positive values indicating winnings and negative values indicating losses.

Note: This representation is simplified and does not cover all possible outcomes or the full complexity of the game's decision tree. Each "Higher card wins" terminal node would need to be expanded into specific outcomes based on the initial card allocation to accurately reflect the game's rules and payoffs.
