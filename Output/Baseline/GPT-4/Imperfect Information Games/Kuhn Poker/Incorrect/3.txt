Given the complexity and depth of the game described, the EFG representation will be quite extensive. Here's a simplified version of the EFG representation for the game described:

```
EFG 2 R "Three-card game between Alice and Bob" { "Alice" "Bob" }
c "" 1 "" { "JQ" 1/6 "JK" 1/6 "QJ" 1/6 "QK" 1/6 "KJ" 1/6 "KQ" 1/6 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "Check" "Bet" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "Check" "Bet" } 0
        t "" 1 "Higher card wins 1" { 1, -1 }
        t "" 2 "Higher card wins 1" { -1, 1 }
    p "" 2 2 "" { "Fold" "Call" } 0
        t "" 3 "Bob wins 1" { -1, 1 }
        t "" 4 "Higher card wins 2" { 2, -2 }
        t "" 5 "Higher card wins 2" { -2, 2 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "Check" "Bet" } 0
    p "" 2 3 "" { "Fold" "Call" } 0
        t "" 6 "Alice wins 1" { 1, -1 }
        t "" 7 "Higher card wins 2" { 2, -2 }
        t "" 8 "Higher card wins 2" { -2, 2 }
```

This representation simplifies the game's structure for readability and focuses on the key decision points and outcomes. It starts with a chance node representing the deal of the cards, followed by Alice's decision to check or bet. Depending on Alice's action, Bob then makes his decision. The terminal nodes represent the game's possible outcomes, including who wins the pot based on the players' actions and the cards' allocation.

Note: The payoffs in the terminal nodes are placeholders to illustrate the structure. The actual payoffs would depend on the specific rules for comparing the cards (e.g., King beats Queen, Queen beats Jack, and Jack beats King in a circular fashion) and might need adjustments based on the game's specific rules for determining the winner in each scenario.
