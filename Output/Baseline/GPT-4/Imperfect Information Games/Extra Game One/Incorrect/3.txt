Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Three-stage game with imperfect information" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "A" "B" "C" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
        p "" 1 2 "" { "G" "H" } 0
            t "" 1 "End after H" { 2, -1 }
            p "" 2 3 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
                t "" 2 "End after Q" { 3, 3 }
                t "" 3 "End after W" { 0, 0 }
        t "" 4 "End after F" { 0, 0 }
    p "" 2 2 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
        p "" 1 3 "" { "G" "H" } 0
            t "" 1 "End after H" { 2, -1 }
            p "" 2 3 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
                t "" 2 "End after Q" { 3, 3 }
                t "" 3 "End after W" { 0, 0 }
        t "" 4 "End after F" { 0, 0 }
```

This representation outlines the structure of the game as described:

- **Player 1** starts the game by choosing among actions **A**, **B**, or **C**.
- Depending on Player 1's choice, **Player 2** then decides among actions **D**, **E**, or **F**. The choice of **F** directly leads to a terminal node with specified payoffs.
- If **Player 2** chooses **D** or **E**, the game moves to the third stage where **Player 1** chooses between **G** and **H**. Choosing **H** ends the game with specific payoffs.
- If **G** is chosen by **Player 1**, **Player 2** then decides between **Q** and **W**, each leading to a terminal node with their respective payoffs.

This structure assumes that Player 2 has imperfect information after Player 1's initial choice, as they know if **A** was chosen but cannot distinguish between **B** and **C**. This is represented by using the same information set number for actions **B** and **C** from Player 1's perspective for Player 2's decision nodes. Terminal nodes are specified with outcomes and payoffs according to the game's rules.
