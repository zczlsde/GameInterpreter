Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Three-stage game with imperfect information" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "A" "B" "C" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
        p "" 1 2 "" { "G" "H" } 0
            t "" 1 "H chosen" { 2, -1 }
            p "" 2 3 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
                t "" 2 "Q chosen" { 3, 3 }
                t "" 3 "W chosen" { 0, 0 }
        t "" 4 "F chosen after A" { 0, 0 }
    p "" 2 2 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
        p "" 1 3 "" { "G" "H" } 0
            t "" 5 "H chosen" { 2, -1 }
            p "" 2 4 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
                t "" 6 "Q chosen" { 3, 3 }
                t "" 7 "W chosen" { 0, 0 }
        t "" 8 "F chosen after B or C" { 0, 0 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

- The game starts with Player 1's decision node where they can choose between actions A, B, or C.
- Depending on Player 1's action, Player 2 then makes a decision. Player 2 knows if A was chosen but cannot distinguish between B and C. This is represented by having two decision nodes for Player 2, one following action A (with information set 1) and one for actions B and C (with information set 2), to reflect the imperfect information.
- If Player 2 chooses F, the game ends with the specified payoffs.
- If Player 2 chooses D or E, the game moves to the next stage where Player 1 decides between G and H.
- Choosing H ends the game with the specified payoffs.
- If G is chosen, Player 2 then decides between Q and W, with the game ending with the specified payoffs for each action.

This representation assumes that the game's structure is common knowledge, and the payoffs are as described in the game description. Note that the information sets for Player 2 are split to represent the knowledge about Player 1's actions, and the outcomes are numbered uniquely for clarity.
