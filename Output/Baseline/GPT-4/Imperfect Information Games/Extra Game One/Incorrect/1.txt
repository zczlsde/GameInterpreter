Based on the game description provided, here is the corresponding EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Three-stage game with imperfect information" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "A" "B" "C" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
        p "" 1 2 "" { "G" "H" } 0
            t "" 1 "End after H" { 2, -1 }
            p "" 2 3 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
                t "" 2 "Both choose Q" { 3, 3 }
                t "" 3 "Both choose W" { 0, 0 }
        t "" 4 "End after F" { 0, 0 }
    p "" 2 2 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
        p "" 1 3 "" { "G" "H" } 0
            t "" 1 "End after H" { 2, -1 }
            p "" 2 3 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
                t "" 2 "Both choose Q" { 3, 3 }
                t "" 3 "Both choose W" { 0, 0 }
        t "" 4 "End after F" { 0, 0 }
```

This representation captures the sequential nature of the game, including the decision points for both players, the actions available at each decision point, and the outcomes associated with each sequence of actions. Note that Player 2's inability to distinguish between actions B and C is represented by using the same information set number (2) for the decision nodes following actions B and C.
