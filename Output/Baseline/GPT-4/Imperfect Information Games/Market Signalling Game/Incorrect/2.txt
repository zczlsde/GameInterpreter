Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Market Entry Game with Signals" { "New Manufacturer" "Existing Manufacturer" }
c "" 1 "" { "S" 2/3 "W" 1/3 } 0
    p "" 1 1 "" { "S" "W" } 0
        p "" 2 1 "" { "F" "A" } 0
            t "" 1 "Strong Signal, Fight" { 1, 0 }
            t "" 2 "Strong Signal, Adapt" { 3, 1 }
        p "" 2 2 "" { "F" "A" } 0
            t "" 3 "Weak Signal, Fight" { 0, 0 }
            t "" 4 "Weak Signal, Adapt" { 2, 1 }
    p "" 1 2 "" { "S" "W" } 0
        p "" 2 3 "" { "F" "A" } 0
            t "" 5 "Strong Signal, Fight" { 0, 2 }
            t "" 6 "Strong Signal, Adapt" { 2, 1 }
        p "" 2 4 "" { "F" "A" } 0
            t "" 7 "Weak Signal, Fight" { 1, 2 }
            t "" 8 "Weak Signal, Adapt" { 3, 1 }
```

This EFG representation outlines the structure of the game where a chance node determines the strength of the new manufacturer, followed by the new manufacturer's decision to send a strong or weak signal. The existing manufacturer then decides whether to compete aggressively or adapt based on the signal observed. The terminal nodes represent the outcomes and payoffs for each combination of actions.
