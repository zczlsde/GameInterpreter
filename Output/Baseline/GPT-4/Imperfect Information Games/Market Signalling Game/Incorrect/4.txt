Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Market Entry Game with Signals" { "Nature" "New Manufacturer" "Existing Manufacturer" }
c "" 1 "" { "Strong" 2/3 "Weak" 1/3 } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "Signal Strong" "Signal Weak" } 0
        p "" 3 1 "" { "Fight" "Adapt" } 0
            t "" 1 "Strong-Signal Strong-Fight" { 1, 0 }
            t "" 2 "Strong-Signal Strong-Adapt" { 3, 1 }
        p "" 3 2 "" { "Fight" "Adapt" } 0
            t "" 3 "Strong-Signal Weak-Fight" { 0, 0 }
            t "" 4 "Strong-Signal Weak-Adapt" { 2, 1 }
    p "" 2 2 "" { "Signal Strong" "Signal Weak" } 0
        p "" 3 3 "" { "Fight" "Adapt" } 0
            t "" 5 "Weak-Signal Strong-Fight" { 0, 2 }
            t "" 6 "Weak-Signal Strong-Adapt" { 2, 1 }
        p "" 3 4 "" { "Fight" "Adapt" } 0
            t "" 7 "Weak-Signal Weak-Fight" { 1, 2 }
            t "" 8 "Weak-Signal Weak-Adapt" { 3, 1 }
```

This EFG representation outlines the structure of the game, starting with a chance node representing Nature's choice of the new manufacturer's strength. It then moves through the decision nodes for the new manufacturer to send a signal and the existing manufacturer to choose a response based on the observed signal. The terminal nodes represent the outcomes of the game with their respective payoffs to the new and existing manufacturers.
