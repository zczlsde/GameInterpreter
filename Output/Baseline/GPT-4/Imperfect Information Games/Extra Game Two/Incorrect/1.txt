This representation assumes that each player's decision node is distinct and that Player 2 and Player 1 make their decisions without knowing the previous choices due to the lack of information sets specified for Player 2's and Player 1's second decision. The game tree expands fully with each player's choices leading to the final decision by Player 3, which determines the final payoffs. Each path through the game is represented, with terminal nodes indicating the outcomes and associated payoffs for each combination of choices.
