This representation outlines the sequential decision-making process across four stages, with Player 1 starting the game by choosing among actions A, B, and C. Player 2 then makes a choice without knowing Player 1's decision, followed by Player 1's second decision after observing Player 2's choice. Finally, Player 3 decides between actions Q and W, with the payoffs determined by Player 3's choice. The tree structure captures the sequential nature of the game and the information available to each player at the time of their decision.
