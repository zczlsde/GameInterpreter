Given the game description and the constraints on the payoffs, here is the EFG representation of the game:

```
EFG 2 R "Strategic Misinterpretation Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
c "" 1 "" { "S interpreted as S" 0.99 "S interpreted as C" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 1 "Both choose S" { A, B }
t "" 2 "P1 chooses S, P2 chooses C" { C, D }
c "" 2 "" { "C interpreted as C" 0.99 "C interpreted as S" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 3 "P1 chooses C, P2 chooses S" { E, C }
t "" 4 "Both choose C" { F, F }
```

This EFG representation follows the structure of the game as described:

1. **Player 1's Decision Node**: Player 1 chooses between "S" and "C".
2. **Chance Node for Misinterpretation**: After Player 1's choice, there's a chance node representing the possibility of Player 2 misinterpreting Player 1's choice. This is modeled as two separate chance nodes following each of Player 1's choices, with probabilities reflecting the chance of correct interpretation and misinterpretation.
   - For "S" chosen by Player 1, there's a 99% chance Player 2 interprets it correctly as "S" and a 1% chance it's misinterpreted as "C".
   - For "C" chosen by Player 1, similarly, there's a 99% chance of correct interpretation as "C" and a 1% chance of misinterpretation as "S".
3. **Player 2's Decision Nodes**: Depending on the interpretation of Player 1's choice, Player 2 then makes a choice between "S" and "C".
4. **Terminal Nodes**: The outcomes with their respective payoffs are listed, satisfying the payoff order E > A > F > C > B > D.

Please note, the actual values of A, B, C, D, E, F are not specified in the description and thus are represented by their placeholders. You would need to substitute these with the actual numerical values that satisfy the given order.
