Given the game description and the constraints on the payoffs, here is the EFG representation of the game:

```
EFG 2 R "Strategic Misinterpretation Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
c "" 1 "" { "Perceived S" 0.99 "Perceived C" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 1 "Both S" { A, B }
t "" 2 "S-C Misinterpretation" { C, D }
c "" 2 "" { "Perceived C" 0.99 "Perceived S" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 3 "C-S Misinterpretation" { E, C }
t "" 4 "Both C" { F, F }
```

This EFG representation follows the structure of the game as described:

1. **Player 1's Decision Node**: Player 1 chooses between "S" and "C".
2. **Chance Node for Misinterpretation**: After Player 1's choice, there's a chance node representing the possibility of Player 2 misinterpreting Player 1's choice. This is modeled as two separate chance nodes following each of Player 1's choices, with probabilities reflecting the 1% chance of misinterpretation.
3. **Player 2's Decision Nodes**: Depending on what Player 2 perceives Player 1's choice to be (either correctly or due to misinterpretation), Player 2 then makes a choice between "S" and "C".
4. **Terminal Nodes**: The game ends after Player 2's choice, with the payoffs to each player depending on the combination of choices made throughout the game.

Please note, the values for A, B, C, D, E, and F are placeholders and should be replaced with actual numbers that satisfy the given order: \(E > A > F > C > B > D\).
