Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation of the game:

```
EFG 2 R "Strategic Misinterpretation Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
c "" 1 "" { "Perceived S" 0.99 "Perceived C" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 1 "Both S" { A, B }
t "" 2 "S-C Misinterpretation" { C, D }
c "" 2 "" { "Perceived C" 0.99 "Perceived S" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 3 "C-S Misinterpretation" { E, C }
t "" 4 "Both C" { F, F }
```

This representation follows the structure of an extensive form game file (EFG) and includes the elements of the game as described:

- Player 1 chooses between "S" and "C".
- There is a chance node to represent the possibility of misinterpretation by Player 2. This is modeled as two separate chance nodes following each of Player 1's choices, with probabilities reflecting the 1% chance of misinterpretation.
- Player 2 makes a choice based on the perceived action of Player 1.
- The terminal nodes represent the outcomes of the game with their respective payoffs, which are placeholders (A, B, C, D, E, F) in this representation. The values of these payoffs must satisfy the order E > A > F > C > B > D, but specific values are not provided in the description and thus are not included in the EFG representation.

Please note, the specific values for A, B, C, D, E, and F are not provided in the game description, so they are represented by their respective placeholders in the terminal nodes. The probabilities and structure reflect the chance of misinterpretation and the sequential decisions made by the players.
