Given the game description and the constraints on the payoffs, here is the EFG representation of the game:

```
EFG 2 R "Strategic Misinterpretation Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
c "" 1 "" { "S interpreted as S" 0.99 "S interpreted as C" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 1 "Both choose S" { A, B }
t "" 2 "P1 S, P2 C" { C, D }
c "" 2 "" { "C interpreted as C" 0.99 "C interpreted as S" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 3 "P1 C, P2 S" { E, C }
t "" 4 "Both choose C" { F, F }
c "" 1 "" { "S interpreted as C" 0.99 "S interpreted as S" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 3 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 2 "P1 S, P2 C misinterpretation" { C, D }
t "" 1 "Both choose S misinterpretation" { A, B }
c "" 2 "" { "C interpreted as S" 0.99 "C interpreted as C" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 4 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 4 "Both choose C misinterpretation" { F, F }
t "" 3 "P1 C, P2 S misinterpretation" { E, C }
```

This EFG representation outlines the game where Player 1 first chooses between strategies "S" and "C". Then, a chance node represents the possibility of Player 2 misinterpreting Player 1's choice, with a 1% chance of misinterpretation. Based on what Player 2 believes to be Player 1's choice, Player 2 then makes a choice between "S" and "C". The terminal nodes represent the outcomes of the game with their respective payoffs, which are determined by the combination of choices made by Player 1 and Player 2, taking into account the possibility of misinterpretation by Player 2. The payoffs (A, B, C, D, E, F) must satisfy the given order: E > A > F > C > B > D, but specific values are not provided in the description, so they are represented by their respective letters in the EFG representation.
