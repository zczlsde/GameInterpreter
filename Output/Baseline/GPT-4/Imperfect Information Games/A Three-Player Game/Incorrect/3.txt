Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Three-player sequential game with incomplete information" { "Player1" "Player2" "Player3" }
c "" 1 "" { "A" 1/2 "B" 1/2 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "L" "R" } 0
t "" 1 "End with R" { 1, 1, 1 }
p "" 2 2 "" { "l" "r" } 0
t "" 2 "End with r" { 2, 2, 2 }
p "" 3 3 "" { "a" "b" } 0
t "" 3 "End with a or b" { 3, 3, 3 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

- The game starts with a chance node (denoted by `c`) that decides between "A" or "B" with equal probability. This is the stage 1 of the game.
- In stage 2, player 1 (denoted by `p` and player number `1`) chooses between "L" or "R" without knowing the outcome of the chance node. If "R" is chosen, the game ends with a payoff of (1, 1, 1), represented by a terminal node (`t`).
- In stage 3, if player 1 chooses "L", player 2 (denoted by `p` and player number `2`) then chooses between "l" or "r" without observing player 1's action. If "r" is chosen, the game ends with a payoff of (2, 2, 2), represented by a terminal node.
- In stage 4, if player 2 chooses "l", player 3 (denoted by `p` and player number `3`) then chooses between "a" or "b" without observing player 2's action. Regardless of the choice between "a" or "b", the game ends with a payoff of (3, 3, 3), represented by a terminal node.

Note: This representation assumes that all players are unaware of the actions taken in previous stages by other players or the outcome of the chance node, as specified in the game description. The information sets for each player are indicated, but since players do not observe previous actions, each decision node for players 1, 2, and 3 is in its unique information set.
