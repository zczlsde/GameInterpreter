Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Three player sequential game with incomplete information" { "Player1" "Player2" "Player3" }
c "" 1 "" { "A" 1/2 "B" 1/2 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "L" "R" } 0
t "" 1 "End with R" { 1, 1, 1 }
p "" 2 2 "" { "l" "r" } 0
t "" 2 "End with r" { 2, 2, 2 }
p "" 3 3 "" { "a" "b" } 0
t "" 3 "End with a" { 3, 3, 3 }
t "" 4 "End with b" { 3, 3, 3 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

- The game starts with a chance node (denoted by `c`) that decides between "A" or "B" with equal probability. This is the stage 1 of the game.
- Player 1 (denoted by `p` and player number `1`) then makes a decision between "L" or "R" without knowing the outcome of the chance node. This is stage 2.
  - If Player 1 chooses "R", the game ends with a payoff of (1, 1, 1) for all players, represented by a terminal node (`t`) with the outcome "End with R".
- If Player 1 chooses "L", the game moves to Player 2 (also denoted by `p` and player number `2`), who chooses between "l" or "r" without observing Player 1's action. This is stage 3.
  - If Player 2 chooses "r", the game ends with a payoff of (2, 2, 2) for all players, represented by a terminal node with the outcome "End with r".
- If Player 2 chooses "l", the game moves to Player 3 (denoted by `p` and player number `3`), who then chooses between "a" or "b" without observing Player 2's action. This is stage 4.
  - Regardless of Player 3's choice, the game ends with a payoff of (3, 3, 3) for all players, represented by two terminal nodes with the outcomes "End with a" and "End with b".

This representation captures the sequential nature of the game, the incomplete information aspect (as players do not observe previous moves or the chance node's outcome), and the payoffs associated with each possible ending of the game.
