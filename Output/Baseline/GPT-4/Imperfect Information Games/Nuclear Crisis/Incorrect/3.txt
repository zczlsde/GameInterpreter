Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation of the game involving Country A and Country B, with their strategic decisions following a provocation:

```
EFG 2 R "Nuclear Crisis Game" { "Country A" "Country B" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Escalate" "Ignore" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "Back Down" "Escalate" } 0
        p "" 1 2 "" { "Retreat" "Detonate" } 0
            p "" 2 2 "" { "Retreat" "Detonate" } 0
                t "" 1 "Mutual Retreat" { -1, -1 }
                t "" 2 "A Detonates, B Retreats" { 10, -10 }
            p "" 2 3 "" { "Retreat" "Detonate" } 0
                t "" 3 "B Detonates, A Retreats" { -10, 10 }
                t "" 4 "Nuclear Disaster" { -100, -100 }
        t "" 5 "B Backs Down" { 1, -1 }
    t "" 6 "A Ignores" { 1, 1 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

- The game starts with Country A's decision node, where they can choose to "Escalate" or "Ignore" the provocation.
- If Country A chooses to "Ignore", the game ends with both countries receiving a small positive payoff.
- If Country A escalates, Country B then decides whether to "Back Down" or "Escalate" further.
- If Country B backs down, Country A receives a small positive payoff, and Country B receives a small negative payoff, ending the game.
- If Country B also escalates, the game moves to the nuclear crisis stage, where Country A must decide to "Retreat" or "Detonate".
- Country B, unaware of Country A's decision, also chooses to "Retreat" or "Detonate".
- The outcomes are as follows:
    - If both countries retreat, they both suffer a small negative payoff.
    - If one country detonates while the other retreats, the detonating country receives a large positive payoff, and the retreating country receives a large negative payoff.
    - If both countries choose to detonate, it results in a nuclear disaster with very large negative payoffs for both.

This representation captures the sequential nature of the decisions and the strategic considerations of both countries following the initial provocation.
