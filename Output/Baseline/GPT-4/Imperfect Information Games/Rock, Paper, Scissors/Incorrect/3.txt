Given the simultaneous nature of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors, we can represent it in an extensive form game format (EFG) by considering it as a game with a chance move at the beginning that determines the combination of actions chosen by the two players. Since the players choose their actions simultaneously, we can model this by having a chance node that leads to all possible outcomes based on the combinations of choices. Here's how the EFG representation might look:

```
EFG 2 R "Rock-Paper-Scissors Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
c "" 1 "" { "R-R" 1/9 "R-P" 1/9 "R-S" 1/9 "P-R" 1/9 "P-P" 1/9 "P-S" 1/9 "S-R" 1/9 "S-P" 1/9 "S-S" 1/9 } 0
t "" 1 "R-R Draw" { 0, 0 }
t "" 2 "R-P P2 Wins" { -1, 1 }
t "" 3 "R-S P1 Wins" { 1, -1 }
t "" 4 "P-R P1 Wins" { 1, -1 }
t "" 5 "P-P Draw" { 0, 0 }
t "" 6 "P-S P2 Wins" { -1, 1 }
t "" 7 "S-R P2 Wins" { -1, 1 }
t "" 8 "S-P P1 Wins" { 1, -1 }
t "" 9 "S-S Draw" { 0, 0 }
```

Explanation:
- The game starts with a chance node (denoted by `c`) that represents the simultaneous decision by both players. The chance node leads to all possible outcomes of the game, with each outcome having an equal probability of 1/9 since there are 9 possible combinations of actions (Rock-Rock, Rock-Paper, Rock-Scissors, Paper-Rock, Paper-Paper, Paper-Scissors, Scissors-Rock, Scissors-Paper, Scissors-Scissors).
- Each terminal node (denoted by `t`) represents a possible outcome of the game, with the payoffs to each player. A win results in a payoff of 1 for the winning player and -1 for the losing player. A draw results in a payoff of 0 for both players.

This representation captures the essence of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in an extensive form, highlighting the simultaneous nature of the game and the possible outcomes based on the players' choices.
