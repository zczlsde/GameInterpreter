Given the simultaneous nature of the moves in Rock-Paper-Scissors, representing this game in an extensive form game (EFG) format requires a slight adjustment to account for the simultaneous decision-making process. This can be achieved by introducing a chance node at the beginning to represent the simultaneous choices, followed by terminal nodes for each possible outcome. Here's how the EFG representation might look for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game:

```
EFG 2 R "Rock-Paper-Scissors Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
c "" 1 "" { "P1:Rock P2:Rock" 1/9 "P1:Rock P2:Paper" 1/9 "P1:Rock P2:Scissors" 1/9 "P1:Paper P2:Rock" 1/9 "P1:Paper P2:Paper" 1/9 "P1:Paper P2:Scissors" 1/9 "P1:Scissors P2:Rock" 1/9 "P1:Scissors P2:Paper" 1/9 "P1:Scissors P2:Scissors" 1/9 } 0
t "" 1 "Both Rock" { 0, 0 }
t "" 2 "P1 Rock, P2 Paper" { -1, 1 }
t "" 3 "P1 Rock, P2 Scissors" { 1, -1 }
t "" 4 "P1 Paper, P2 Rock" { 1, -1 }
t "" 5 "Both Paper" { 0, 0 }
t "" 6 "P1 Paper, P2 Scissors" { -1, 1 }
t "" 7 "P1 Scissors, P2 Rock" { -1, 1 }
t "" 8 "P1 Scissors, P2 Paper" { 1, -1 }
t "" 9 "Both Scissors" { 0, 0 }
```

Explanation:
- The game starts with a chance node (denoted by `c`) to represent the simultaneous move by both players. Each combination of moves by the two players (Player 1 and Player 2) is represented as an action with equal probability (1/9, since there are 9 possible outcomes when each player can choose among 3 options).
- Following the chance node, there are terminal nodes (denoted by `t`) for each possible outcome of the game. The outcomes are labeled based on the moves chosen by the players (e.g., "Both Rock", "P1 Rock, P2 Paper", etc.), with the corresponding payoffs for each player. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, a win awards a payoff of 1, a loss a payoff of -1, and a tie a payoff of 0 for both players.

This representation captures the essence of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including the simultaneous nature of moves and the outcomes based on the rules of the game.
