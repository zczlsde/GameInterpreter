Certainly! Given the simultaneous nature of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors, we can represent it in an extensive form game format (EFG) as follows:

```
EFG 2 R "Rock-Paper-Scissors Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
c "" 1 "" { "Rock" 1/3 "Paper" 1/3 "Scissors" 1/3 } 0
    p "" 1 1 "" { "Rock" "Paper" "Scissors" } 0
        p "" 2 1 "" { "Rock" "Paper" "Scissors" } 0
            t "" 1 "P1 Rock - P2 Rock" { 0, 0 }
            t "" 2 "P1 Rock - P2 Paper" { -1, 1 }
            t "" 3 "P1 Rock - P2 Scissors" { 1, -1 }
        p "" 2 2 "" { "Rock" "Paper" "Scissors" } 0
            t "" 4 "P1 Paper - P2 Rock" { 1, -1 }
            t "" 5 "P1 Paper - P2 Paper" { 0, 0 }
            t "" 6 "P1 Paper - P2 Scissors" { -1, 1 }
        p "" 2 3 "" { "Rock" "Paper" "Scissors" } 0
            t "" 7 "P1 Scissors - P2 Rock" { -1, 1 }
            t "" 8 "P1 Scissors - P2 Paper" { 1, -1 }
            t "" 9 "P1 Scissors - P2 Scissors" { 0, 0 }
```

This representation starts with a chance node to simulate the simultaneous decision-making process of the two players. Each player then has a decision node where they can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The terminal nodes represent the outcomes of the game based on the simultaneous choices, with the payoffs for each player according to the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
