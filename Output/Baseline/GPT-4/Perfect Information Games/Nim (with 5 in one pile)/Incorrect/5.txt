Given the game description, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Five Stones Game" { "Alice" "Bob" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
        p "" 1 2 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
            p "" 2 2 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
                p "" 1 3 "" { "Take 1" } 0
                    t "" 1 "Alice loss" { -1, 1 }
                p "" 2 3 "" { "Take 2" } 0
                    t "" 2 "Bob loss" { 1, -1 }
            p "" 1 4 "" { "Take 2" } 0
                p "" 2 4 "" { "Take 1" } 0

            p "" 1 5 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
                p "" 2 5 "" { "Take 1" } 0

```

This EFG representation outlines the decision tree for the game described, including the moves available to Alice and Bob at each stage, and the outcomes of their decisions. Note that the representation simplifies the game's structure into a series of decision nodes (p) for each player and terminal nodes (t) that represent the game's outcomes. Each decision node specifies the player making the decision, the actions available, and leads to further decision nodes or terminal nodes indicating the game's outcome. The terminal nodes specify the outcome's name and the payoffs to each player, with Alice being player 1 and Bob being player 2.
