Given the detailed game description, here is the EFG representation for the game between Alice and Bob, where the goal is to avoid taking the last stone from a pile of five stones:

```

```

This EFG representation outlines the decision points for both Alice and Bob, including their choices to take one or two stones from the pile and the resulting outcomes in terms of winning or losing the game. The game tree is structured to reflect the sequential decisions and the terminal nodes indicate the final outcomes with the corresponding payoffs for both players.
