Given the game description, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Avoid the last stone game" { "Alice" "Bob" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
    p "" 2 2 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
        p "" 1 3 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
            p "" 2 4 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
                p "" 1 5 "" { "Take 1" } 0
                    t "" 1 "Alice loss" { -1, 1 }
                p "" 2 6 "" { "Take 2" } 0
                    t "" 2 "Bob loss" { 1, -1 }
            p "" 1 7 "" { "Take 2" } 0
                p "" 2 8 "" { "Take 1" } 0

            p "" 1 10 "" { "Take 1" "Take 2" } 0
                p "" 2 11 "" { "Take 1" } 0

This EFG representation outlines the decision tree for Alice and Bob in the game where they aim to avoid taking the last stone. Each player's decision node is represented, including the options to "Take 1" or "Take 2" stones, leading to various outcomes where either player can win or lose based on their decisions. The terminal nodes indicate the game's outcome, with payoffs assigned according to whether a player wins (earns one point) or loses (loses one point).
