Given the game description, here is the EFG representation:

This EFG representation outlines the decision tree for the game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns removing one or two stones from a pile of five. The game's goal is to avoid taking the last stone, with the winner earning one point and the loser losing one point. Each decision node (represented by `p`) corresponds to a player's turn, where they can choose to "Take 1" or "Take 2" stones, except in situations where only one stone is left. Terminal nodes (represented by `t`) indicate the game's outcome, specifying the points earned or lost by each player.
