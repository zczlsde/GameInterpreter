Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Negotiation Game" { "A" "B" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Propose 5500-4500" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Accept" "Reject" } 0
t "" 1 "Agreement on 5500-4500" { 5500, 4500 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "Propose 5000-5000" } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "Accept" "Reject" } 0
t "" 2 "Agreement on 5000-5000" { 4750, 4750 }
p "" 1 3 "" { "Propose 5200-4800" } 0
t "" 3 "Final Agreement 5200-4800" { 4693, 4332 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

1. The game starts with player A proposing a distribution plan of 5500 for A and 4500 for B.
2. Player B then decides whether to accept or reject this proposal.
   - If B accepts, the game ends with A receiving 5500 and B receiving 4500.
   - If B rejects, the game moves to the next stage where A must propose an equal split of 5000 each.
3. In the scenario where B rejects the first proposal, A proposes an equal split of 5000 pounds each.
4. B then has the option to accept or reject this proposal.
   - If B accepts, the game ends with both A and B receiving 4750.
   - If B rejects, A proposes a new plan where A receives 5200 and B receives 4800, and B has no option but to accept.
5. The game ends with the final agreement where A receives 4693 and B receives 4332.

This representation captures the sequential nature of the negotiation, the decisions made by each player, and the outcomes associated with each decision.
