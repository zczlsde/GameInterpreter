Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

1. The game starts with player A proposing a distribution plan where A gets 5500 and B gets 4500. This is represented as a personal player node for player A with the action "Propose 5500-4500".

2. Player B then decides whether to accept or reject this proposal. This decision is represented as a personal player node for player B with the actions "Accept" and "Reject".

3. If B accepts, the game ends with the specified payoffs (5500 for A and 4500 for B), represented as a terminal node.

4. If B rejects, A proposes an equal split of 5000 pounds each. This is represented as another personal player node for player A.

5. B then has the option again to accept or reject A's new proposal. This decision is represented as another personal player node for player B.

6. If B accepts the equal split, the game ends with both A and B receiving 4750, represented as a terminal node.

7. If B rejects the equal split, A proposes a new plan where A receives 5200 and B receives 4800, and B has no right to reject. This is represented as a personal player node for player A with the action "Propose 5200-4800".

8. The game ends with A receiving 4693 and B receiving 4332, represented as a terminal node.

This EFG representation captures the sequential nature of the negotiation game, including the decision points for both players and the final outcomes based on those decisions.
