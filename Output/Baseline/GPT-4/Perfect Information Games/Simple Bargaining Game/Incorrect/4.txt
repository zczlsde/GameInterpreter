Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Negotiation over division of 10,000 pounds" { "A" "B" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Propose 5500-4500" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Accept" "Reject" } 0
t "" 1 "Agreement on 5500-4500" { 5500, 4500 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "Propose 5000-5000" } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "Accept" "Reject" } 0
t "" 2 "Agreement on 5000-5000" { 4750, 4750 }
p "" 1 3 "" { "Propose 5200-4800" } 0
t "" 3 "Final agreement on 5200-4800" { 4693, 4332 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

1. The game starts with player A proposing a distribution plan where A gets 5500 and B gets 4500.
2. Player B then decides whether to accept or reject this proposal.
   - If B accepts, the game ends with the specified payoffs.
   - If B rejects, the game moves to the next stage where A has to accept B's proposal of an equal split.
3. In the scenario where B rejects A's first proposal, A then proposes an equal split of 5000 pounds each.
4. B's decision at this stage is not explicitly mentioned in the game description but is implied to be an automatic acceptance, leading to a negotiation end with both A and B receiving 4750.
5. If A rejects B's proposal (which is not an option given in the description but is structured for the sake of completeness in the EFG format), A proposes a new plan where A receives 5200 and B receives 4800, which B has to accept.
6. The final amounts (4693 for A and 4332 for B) represent the payoffs after this last negotiation stage.

This EFG representation captures the sequential nature of the negotiation, the decisions made by each player at each stage, and the resulting payoffs based on those decisions.
