Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Negotiation over division of 10,000 pounds" { "A" "B" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Propose 5500-4500" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Accept" "Reject" } 0
t "" 1 "Agreement on 5500-4500" { 5500, 4500 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "Propose 5000-5000" } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "Accept" "Reject" } 0
t "" 2 "Agreement on 5000-5000" { 4750, 4750 }
p "" 1 3 "" { "Propose 5200-4800" } 0
t "" 3 "Final agreement on 5200-4800" { 4693, 4332 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

1. The game starts with player A proposing a distribution plan of 5500 for A and 4500 for B.
2. Player B then decides whether to accept or reject this proposal.
   - If B accepts, the game ends with the payoffs as described.
   - If B rejects, the game moves to the next stage where A has to accept B's proposal of an equal split.
3. In the scenario where B rejects A's first proposal, A then decides whether to accept B's equal split proposal.
   - If A accepts, the game ends with both players receiving 4750.
   - If A rejects, A proposes a new plan where A gets 5200 and B gets 4800, which B has to accept, ending the game with A receiving 4693 and B receiving 4332 as their final payoffs.

This representation captures the sequential nature of the negotiation, the decisions made by each player at each stage, and the final outcomes based on those decisions.
