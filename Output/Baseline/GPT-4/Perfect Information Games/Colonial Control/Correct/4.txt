Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Diplomacy and Conflict" { "Country A" "Country B" }
p "" 2 1 "" { "Accept" "Rebel" } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "Tax" "Drop Taxes" } 0
t "" 1 "Taxation" { 6, -2 }
t "" 2 "No Tax" { 4, 0 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "Grant Independence" "Suppress" } 0
t "" 3 "Independence Granted" { 0, 3 }
c "" 1 "" { "B Wins" 0.3 "B Loses" 0.7 } 0
t "" 4 "B Wins War" { -1, -3 }
t "" 5 "B Loses War" { -1, -5 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

- The game starts with Country B (player 2) deciding whether to "Accept" the status quo or "Rebel" against it.
- If Country B accepts, the decision moves to Country A (player 1) to choose between continuing to "Tax" or "Drop Taxes".
  - If Country A taxes, it leads to a terminal node with payoffs (6, -2).
  - If Country A drops taxes, it leads to a terminal node with payoffs (4, 0).
- If Country B rebels, Country A decides whether to "Grant Independence" or "Suppress" the rebellion.
  - Granting independence leads to a terminal node with payoffs (0, 3).
  - Suppressing the rebellion leads to a chance node representing the outcome of the war.
    - With a 0.3 probability, Country B wins the war, leading to a terminal node with payoffs (-1, -3).
    - With a 0.7 probability, Country B loses the war, leading to a terminal node with payoffs (-1, -5).

This EFG representation captures the sequential decisions, chance outcomes, and payoffs as described in the game.
