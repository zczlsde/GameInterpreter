Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Diplomacy and Conflict" { "Country A" "Country B" }
p "" 2 1 "" { "Accept" "Rebel" } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "Tax" "Drop Taxes" } 0
t "" 1 "Taxation" { 6, -2 }
t "" 2 "No Tax" { 4, 0 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "Grant Independence" "Suppress" } 0
t "" 3 "Independence Granted" { 0, 3 }
c "" 1 "" { "B Wins" 0.3 "B Loses" 0.7 } 0
t "" 4 "B Wins War" { -1, -3 }
t "" 5 "B Loses War" { -1, -5 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

- The game starts with Country B deciding whether to "Accept" the status quo or "Rebel" against it.
- If Country B accepts, Country A then chooses to either "Tax" or "Drop Taxes".
  - If Country A taxes, the outcome is a payoff of 6 for Country A and -2 for Country B.
  - If Country A drops taxes, the outcome is a payoff of 4 for Country A and 0 for Country B.
- If Country B rebels, Country A has the choice to "Grant Independence" or "Suppress" the rebellion.
  - Granting independence results in a payoff of 0 for Country A and 3 for Country B.
  - Suppressing the rebellion leads to a chance node representing the outcome of the war.
    - With a probability of 0.3, Country B wins the war, resulting in a payoff of -1 for Country A and -3 for Country B.
    - With a probability of 0.7, Country B loses the war, resulting in a payoff of -1 for Country A and -5 for Country B.

This representation captures the strategic decisions and outcomes described in the game, including the probabilistic nature of the war's outcome.
