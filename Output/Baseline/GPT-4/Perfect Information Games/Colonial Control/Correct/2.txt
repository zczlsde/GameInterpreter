Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Diplomacy and Conflict" { "Country A" "Country B" }
p "" 2 1 "" { "Accept" "Rebel" } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "Tax" "Drop Taxes" } 0
t "" 1 "Taxation" { 6, -2 }
t "" 2 "No Tax" { 4, 0 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "Grant Independence" "Suppress" } 0
t "" 3 "Independence Granted" { 0, 3 }
c "" 1 "" { "B Wins" 0.3 "B Loses" 0.7 } 0
t "" 4 "B Wins War" { -1, -3 }
t "" 5 "B Loses War" { -1, -5 }
```

Explanation of the EFG representation:

- The game starts with Country B deciding whether to "Accept" the status quo or "Rebel" against it.
- If Country B accepts, Country A then chooses to either "Tax" or "Drop Taxes".
  - If Country A taxes, the outcome is Country A earning 6 and Country B losing 2.
  - If Country A drops taxes, the outcome is Country A earning 4 and Country B earning 0.
- If Country B rebels, Country A has the choice to "Grant Independence" or "Suppress" the rebellion.
  - Granting independence leads to Country A earning 0 and Country B earning 3.
  - Suppressing the rebellion leads to a chance node representing the outcome of the war, with Country B winning with a probability of 0.3.
    - If Country B wins the war, the outcome is Country B losing 3 and Country A losing 1.
    - If Country B loses the war, the outcome is Country B losing 5 and Country A losing 1.

This representation captures the sequential decisions and the chance event (outcome of the war) as described in the game.
