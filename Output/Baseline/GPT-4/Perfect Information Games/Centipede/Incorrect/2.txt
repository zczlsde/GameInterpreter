Given the game description, here's the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Coin Doubling Game" { "Alice" "Bob" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Push" "Take" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "Push" "Take" } 0
        p "" 1 2 "" { "Push" "Take" } 0
            p "" 2 2 "" { "Push" "Take" } 0
                t "" 1 "Alice 16, Bob 4" { 16, 4 }
                t "" 2 "Alice 4, Bob 16" { 4, 16 }
            t "" 3 "Alice 4, Bob 8" { 4, 8 }
        t "" 4 "Alice 8, Bob 2" { 8, 2 }
    t "" 5 "Alice 2, Bob 8" { 2, 8 }
t "" 6 "Alice 1, Bob 4" { 1, 4 }
```

This representation outlines the structure of the game where Alice and Bob can either "Push" the piles of coins to the other player, doubling their amounts, or "Take" the larger pile for themselves and give the smaller pile to the other player. The game tree is constructed based on the sequence of moves and the doubling rule for the piles of coins. Each terminal node represents a possible outcome of the game with the corresponding payoffs for Alice and Bob, depending on the sequence of actions taken by both players.
