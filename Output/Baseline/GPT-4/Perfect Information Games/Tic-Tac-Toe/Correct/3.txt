Given the complexity of the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the specific scenario described, the EFG representation will focus on the key decision points as outlined in the game description. This representation will simplify the extensive form to fit the structure provided in the examples.

```
EFG 2 R "Tic-Tac-Toe Game" { "Player X" "Player O" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "(0, 0)" "(0, 2)" "(1, 0)" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "(0, 2)" "(1, 0)" } 0
        t "" 1 "O wins" { -1, 1 }
        p "" 1 2 "" { "(0, 2)" } 0
            t "" 2 "X wins" { 1, -1 }
    t "" 3 "X wins" { 1, -1 }
    p "" 2 2 "" { "(0, 0)" "(0, 2)" } 0
        p "" 1 3 "" { "(0, 2)" } 0
            t "" 4 "X wins" { 1, -1 }
        t "" 5 "O wins" { -1, 1 }
```

This EFG representation captures the decision points for both players "X" and "O" based on the game description provided. Each decision node (represented by `p`) outlines the possible actions for the player at that point, and the terminal nodes (represented by `t`) indicate the outcome of the game given the sequence of moves leading to that point. The outcomes are simplified to reflect the win/loss condition with the corresponding payoffs for each player.
