Given the game description, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Tic-Tac-Toe Game" { "Player X" "Player O" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "(0, 0)" "(0, 2)" "(1, 0)" } 0
    p "" 2 1 "" { "(0, 2)" "(1, 0)" } 0
        t "" 1 "O wins" { -1, 1 }
        p "" 1 2 "" { "(0, 2)" } 0
            t "" 2 "X wins" { 1, -1 }
    t "" 3 "X wins" { 1, -1 }
    p "" 2 2 "" { "(0, 0)" "(0, 2)" } 0
        p "" 1 3 "" { "(0, 2)" } 0
            t "" 4 "X wins" { 1, -1 }
        t "" 5 "O wins" { -1, 1 }
```

This EFG representation outlines the possible moves and outcomes for the given Tic-Tac-Toe game state. Each player's decision node is marked with "p", followed by the player's turn, the information set (which in this simplified example is unique for each decision point), and the available actions. Terminal nodes are marked with "t", indicating the game's outcome based on the preceding moves. The payoffs for each outcome are provided, with 1 indicating a win and -1 indicating a loss.
