Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Chance and strategic moves game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
c "" 1 "" { "A" 1/4 "B" 1/4 "C" 1/4 "D" 1/4 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "E" "F" "G" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
t "" 1 "A-Q" { 1, -1 }
t "" 2 "A-W" { 2, -2 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "E" "F" "G" } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
t "" 3 "B-Q" { 3, -3 }
t "" 4 "B-W" { -3, 3 }
p "" 1 3 "" { "E" "F" "G" } 0
p "" 2 3 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
t "" 5 "C-Q" { 0, 0 }
t "" 6 "C-W" { -1, 1 }
p "" 1 4 "" { "E" "F" "G" } 0
p "" 2 4 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
t "" 7 "D-Q" { 4, -4 }
t "" 8 "D-W" { -4, 4 }
```

This representation outlines the structure of the game starting with a chance node that determines the state of the world (A, B, C, or D). Following this, Player 1 makes a decision among actions E, F, or G. Player 2 then observes Player 1's action and decides between Q and W. The terminal nodes represent the outcomes of the game with their associated payoffs for both players.
