Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

This representation starts with the prologue indicating it's an extensive form game file (EFG), version 2, with rational numbers, and includes a title. It lists two players, Player 1 and Player 2.

The game begins with a chance node (`c`) that selects one of four outcomes (A, B, C, or D) with equal probability. Following the chance node, Player 1 decides among three actions (E, F, G) at a personal node (`p`). Then, Player 2 observes Player 1's action and chooses between two actions (Q, W) at another personal node. The terminal nodes (`t`) specify the payoffs for each combination of actions and outcomes from the chance node.
