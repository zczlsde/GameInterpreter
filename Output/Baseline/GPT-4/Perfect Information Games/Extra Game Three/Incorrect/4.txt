Based on the game description provided, here is the EFG representation:

```
EFG 2 R "Chance node with subsequent decisions by Player 1 and Player 2" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
c "" 1 "" { "A" 1/4 "B" 1/4 "C" 1/4 "D" 1/4 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "E" "F" "G" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
t "" 1 "A-Q" { 1, -1 }
t "" 2 "A-W" { 2, -2 }
t "" 3 "B-Q" { 3, -3 }
t "" 4 "B-W" { -3, 3 }
t "" 5 "C-Q" { 0, 0 }
t "" 6 "C-W" { -1, 1 }
t "" 7 "D-Q" { 4, -4 }
t "" 8 "D-W" { -4, 4 }
```

This representation outlines the structure of the game starting with a chance node that determines the state of the world (A, B, C, or D) with equal probability. Following this, Player 1 makes a decision among three actions (E, F, G), and then Player 2 responds with a choice between two actions (Q, W). The terminal nodes specify the payoffs for each player based on the sequence of actions taken, starting from the outcome of the chance node.
