Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the described negotiation game:

```
EFG 2 R "Negotiation Game" { "A" "B" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Propose 5500/4500" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Accept" "Reject" } 0
t "" 1 "Accepted 5500/4500" { 5500, 4500 }
p "" 2 2 "" { "Propose 5000/5000" } 0
p "" 1 2 "" { "Accept" "Reject" } 0
t "" 2 "Accepted 5000/5000" { 4750, 4750 }
p "" 1 3 "" { "Propose 5200/4800" } 0
t "" 3 "Accepted 5200/4800" { 4693, 4332 }
```

Explanation:
- Player A starts by proposing a distribution plan where A gets 5500 and B gets 4500.
- Player B can either accept or reject this proposal.
- If B accepts, the game ends with payoffs of 5500 for A and 4500 for B.
- If B rejects, B proposes an equal split of 5000 each.
- A can either accept or reject B's proposal.
- If A accepts, both receive 4750.
- If A rejects, A proposes a new plan where A gets 5200 and B gets 4800, which B must accept, resulting in payoffs of 4693 for A and 4332 for B.
