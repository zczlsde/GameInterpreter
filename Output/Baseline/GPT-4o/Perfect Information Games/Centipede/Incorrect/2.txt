Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the described game:

```
EFG 2 R "Coin Doubling Game" { "Alice" "Bob" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Take" "Push" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Take" "Push" } 0
p "" 1 2 "" { "Take" "Push" } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "Take" "Push" } 0
t "" 1 "Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1" { 4, 1 }
t "" 2 "Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4" { 1, 4 }
t "" 3 "Bob takes 8, Alice takes 2" { 2, 8 }
t "" 4 "Bob takes 2, Alice takes 8" { 8, 2 }
t "" 5 "Alice takes 16, Bob takes 4" { 16, 4 }
t "" 6 "Alice takes 4, Bob takes 16" { 4, 16 }
t "" 7 "Bob takes 32, Alice takes 8" { 8, 32 }
t "" 8 "Bob takes 8, Alice takes 32" { 32, 8 }
t "" 9 "Alice takes 64, Bob takes 16" { 64, 16 }
t "" 10 "Alice takes 16, Bob takes 64" { 16, 64 }
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**:
  - The game starts with Alice's decision node (p) where she can either "Take" the larger pile (4 coins) or "Push" the piles to Bob.
  - If Alice "Pushes", Bob then has a decision node where he can either "Take" the larger pile (8 coins) or "Push" the piles back to Alice.
  - This process continues for four moves, alternating between Alice and Bob.
  
- **Terminal Nodes**:
  - The terminal nodes (t) represent the outcomes of the game based on the actions taken by Alice and Bob.
  - The payoffs are determined by the number of coins each player ends up with at the end of the game.

- **Payoffs**:
  - The payoffs are structured such that the player who "Takes" the larger pile receives the corresponding number of coins, while the other player receives the smaller pile.
  - If the game ends without either player taking the coins, Alice receives the larger pile, and Bob receives the smaller pile.
