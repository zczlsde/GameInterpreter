Certainly! The game described is a simultaneous move game known as "Rock, Paper, Scissors." In this game, both players choose their actions simultaneously, and the payoffs depend on the combination of actions chosen by the players. Here's the EFG representation for this game:

```
EFG 2 R "Rock, Paper, Scissors" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Rock" "Paper" "Scissors" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Rock" "Paper" "Scissors" } 0
t "" 1 "Draw" { 0, 0 }
t "" 2 "Player 1 wins" { 1, -1 }
t "" 3 "Player 2 wins" { -1, 1 }
t "" 4 "Player 2 wins" { -1, 1 }
t "" 5 "Draw" { 0, 0 }
t "" 6 "Player 1 wins" { 1, -1 }
t "" 7 "Player 1 wins" { 1, -1 }
t "" 8 "Player 2 wins" { -1, 1 }
t "" 9 "Draw" { 0, 0 }
```

Explanation:
- Both players simultaneously choose one of the three actions: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The outcomes are determined by the combination of actions:
  - If both players choose the same action, the result is a draw with payoffs {0, 0}.
  - If Player 1's action beats Player 2's action, Player 1 wins with payoffs {1, -1}.
  - If Player 2's action beats Player 1's action, Player 2 wins with payoffs {-1, 1}.
