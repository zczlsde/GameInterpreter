Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the game described:

```
EFG 2 R "Market Entry Game" { "New Manufacturer" "Existing Manufacturer" }
c "" 1 "" { "Strong" 2/3 "Weak" 1/3 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "Strong Signal" "Weak Signal" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Fight" "Adapt" } 0
t "" 1 "Strong-Strong-Fight" { 1, 0 }
t "" 2 "Strong-Strong-Adapt" { 3, 1 }
p "" 2 2 "" { "Fight" "Adapt" } 0
t "" 3 "Strong-Weak-Fight" { 0, 0 }
t "" 4 "Strong-Weak-Adapt" { 2, 1 }
p "" 2 3 "" { "Fight" "Adapt" } 0
t "" 5 "Weak-Strong-Fight" { 0, 2 }
t "" 6 "Weak-Strong-Adapt" { 2, 1 }
p "" 2 4 "" { "Fight" "Adapt" } 0
t "" 7 "Weak-Weak-Fight" { 1, 2 }
t "" 8 "Weak-Weak-Adapt" { 3, 1 }
```

This representation captures the structure of the game, including the chance node for the new manufacturer's strength, the signaling by the new manufacturer, and the decision-making by the existing manufacturer based on the observed signal. The payoffs are specified for each terminal node, reflecting the outcomes of the different strategies.
