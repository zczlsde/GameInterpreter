Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the described game:

```
EFG 2 R "Three-stage game with forgetting" { "Player 1" }
c "" 1 "" { "L" 1/2 "R" 1/2 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "l" "r" } 0
p "" 1 2 "" { "A" "B" } 0
t "" 1 "" { 0 }
t "" 2 "" { 0 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "A" "B" } 0
t "" 1 "" { 0 }
t "" 2 "" { 0 }
p "" 1 1 "" { "l" "r" } 0
p "" 1 2 "" { "A" "B" } 0
t "" 1 "" { 0 }
t "" 2 "" { 0 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "A" "B" } 0
t "" 1 "" { 0 }
t "" 2 "" { 0 }
``` 

In this representation:
- The game starts with a chance node determining L or R with equal probability.
- Player 1 then observes the outcome and chooses between l or r.
- In the final stage, Player 1 chooses between A or B, having forgotten the outcome of stage 1.
- All payoffs are set to 0 as specified.
