Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the described game:

```
EFG 2 R "Three-stage game with forgetting" { "Player 1" }
c "" 1 "" { "L" 1/2 "R" 1/2 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "l" "r" } 0
p "" 1 2 "" { "A" "B" } 0
t "" 1 "" { 0 }
t "" 2 "" { 0 }
p "" 1 3 "" { "A" "B" } 0
t "" 3 "" { 0 }
t "" 4 "" { 0 }
p "" 1 1 "" { "l" "r" } 0
p "" 1 2 "" { "A" "B" } 0
t "" 1 "" { 0 }
t "" 2 "" { 0 }
p "" 1 3 "" { "A" "B" } 0
t "" 3 "" { 0 }
t "" 4 "" { 0 }
```

Explanation:
- The game starts with a chance node where "L" or "R" is chosen with equal probability.
- Player 1 then observes the outcome and chooses between "l" or "r".
- In the third stage, Player 1 chooses between "A" or "B", having forgotten the outcome of the first stage.
- All payoffs are set to 0 as specified.
