Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the game described:

```
EFG 2 R "Misinterpretation Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
c "" 1 "" { "S" 0.99 "C" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 1 "Both choose S" { A, B }
t "" 2 "Player 1 chooses S, Player 2 chooses C" { C, D }
p "" 2 2 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 3 "Player 1 chooses C, Player 2 chooses S" { E, C }
t "" 4 "Both choose C" { F, F }
c "" 2 "" { "S" 0.01 "C" 0.99 } 0
p "" 2 3 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 1 "Both choose S" { A, B }
t "" 2 "Player 1 chooses S, Player 2 chooses C" { C, D }
p "" 2 4 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 3 "Player 1 chooses C, Player 2 chooses S" { E, C }
t "" 4 "Both choose C" { F, F }
```

In this representation:
- Player 1 chooses between "S" and "C".
- There is a chance node representing the misinterpretation by Player 2, with probabilities 0.99 and 0.01 for correct and incorrect interpretation, respectively.
- Player 2 then makes a decision based on their belief of Player 1's choice.
- The terminal nodes represent the payoffs for each combination of choices, with the order of payoffs satisfying E > A > F > C > B > D.
