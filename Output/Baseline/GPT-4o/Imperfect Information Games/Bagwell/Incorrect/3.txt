Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the game described:

```
EFG 2 R "Misinterpretation Game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
c "" 1 "" { "Correct" 0.99 "Misinterpret" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 1 "Both choose S" { A, B }
t "" 2 "Player 1 S, Player 2 C" { C, D }
p "" 2 2 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 3 "Player 1 C, Player 2 S" { E, C }
t "" 4 "Both choose C" { F, F }
c "" 2 "" { "Correct" 0.99 "Misinterpret" 0.01 } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 1 "Both choose S" { A, B }
t "" 2 "Player 1 S, Player 2 C" { C, D }
p "" 2 2 "" { "S" "C" } 0
t "" 3 "Player 1 C, Player 2 S" { E, C }
t "" 4 "Both choose C" { F, F }
```

In this representation:
- Player 1 chooses between "S" and "C".
- There is a chance node for Player 2's interpretation with a 99% probability of correct interpretation and a 1% probability of misinterpretation.
- Player 2 then chooses between "S" and "C" based on their interpretation.
- The payoffs are given for each combination of choices, with the constraints E > A > F > C > B > D.
