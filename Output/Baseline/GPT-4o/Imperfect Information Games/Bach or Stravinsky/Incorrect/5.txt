Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the "Bach or Stravinsky?" game:

```
EFG 2 R "Bach or Stravinsky?" { "Alexis" "Beverley" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "Bach" "Stravinsky" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "Bach" "Stravinsky" } 0

Explanation:
- The game involves two players, Alexis and Beverley.
- Both players make their decisions simultaneously and independently.
- The payoffs are structured such that if both choose Bach, Alexis (the Bach lover) gets a higher payoff (2) and Beverley gets a lower payoff (1).
- If both choose Stravinsky, Beverley (the Stravinsky lover) gets a higher payoff (2) and Alexis gets a lower payoff (1).
- If they choose different concerts, both receive a payoff of 0.
