Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the described game:

```
EFG 2 R "Three players game with chance node" { "Player 1" "Player 2" "Player 3" }
c "" 1 "" { "A" 1/2 "B" 1/2 } 0
p "" 1 1 "" { "L" "R" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "l" "r" } 0
p "" 3 1 "" { "a" "b" } 0
t "" 1 "Outcome 1" { 3, 3, 3 }
t "" 1 "Outcome 2" { 3, 3, 3 }
t "" 2 "Outcome 3" { 2, 2, 2 }
t "" 3 "Outcome 4" { 1, 1, 1 }
p "" 1 2 "" { "L" "R" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "l" "r" } 0
p "" 3 1 "" { "a" "b" } 0
t "" 1 "Outcome 1" { 3, 3, 3 }
t "" 1 "Outcome 2" { 3, 3, 3 }
t "" 2 "Outcome 3" { 2, 2, 2 }
t "" 3 "Outcome 4" { 1, 1, 1 }
```

Explanation:
- The game starts with a chance node deciding between "A" and "B" with equal probability.
- Player 1 then chooses between "L" and "R". If "R" is chosen, the game ends with a payoff of (1, 1, 1).
- If "L" is chosen, Player 2 chooses between "l" and "r". If "r" is chosen, the game ends with a payoff of (2, 2, 2).
- If "l" is chosen, Player 3 chooses between "a" and "b", and the game ends with a payoff of (3, 3, 3) regardless of Player 3's choice.
- The structure is repeated for both outcomes of the chance node, as players do not know the previous moves.
