Certainly! Below is the EFG representation of the described game:

```
EFG 2 R "Three-stage game" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }
p "" 1 1 "" { "A" "B" "C" } 0
p "" 2 1 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
p "" 1 2 "" { "G" "H" } 0
p "" 2 2 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
t "" 1 "Outcome Q" { 3, 3 }
t "" 2 "Outcome W" { 0, 0 }
t "" 3 "Outcome H" { 2, -1 }
p "" 2 3 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
p "" 1 3 "" { "G" "H" } 0
p "" 2 4 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
t "" 1 "Outcome Q" { 3, 3 }
t "" 2 "Outcome W" { 0, 0 }
t "" 3 "Outcome H" { 2, -1 }
p "" 2 3 "" { "D" "E" "F" } 0
p "" 1 3 "" { "G" "H" } 0
p "" 2 4 "" { "Q" "W" } 0
t "" 1 "Outcome Q" { 3, 3 }
t "" 2 "Outcome W" { 0, 0 }

```

Explanation:
- Player 1 starts with actions A, B, or C.
- If Player 1 chooses A, Player 2 knows and chooses between D, E, and F.
- If Player 2 chooses F, the game ends.
- If Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1 chooses between G and H.
- If Player 1 chooses H, the game ends with payoffs (2, -1).
- If Player 1 chooses G, Player 2 chooses between Q and W, with payoffs (3, 3) for Q and (0, 0) for W.
- The same structure is repeated for actions B and C, as Player 2 cannot distinguish between them.
