```

Explanation:
- Player 1 starts with three actions: A, B, or C.
- If Player 1 chooses A, Player 2 knows this and chooses between D, E, and F.
- If Player 2 chooses F, the game ends with payoffs (0, 0).
- If Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1 then chooses between G and H.
- If Player 1 chooses H, the game ends with payoffs (2, -1).
- If Player 1 chooses G, Player 2 chooses between Q and W.
- Choosing Q results in payoffs (3, 3), and choosing W results in payoffs (0, 0).
- If Player 1 chooses B or C initially, Player 2 cannot distinguish between them and has the same options as when A was chosen.
