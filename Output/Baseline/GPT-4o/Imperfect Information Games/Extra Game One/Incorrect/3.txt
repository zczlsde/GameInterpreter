Explanation:
- The game starts with Player 1 choosing between actions A, B, or C.
- If Player 1 chooses A, Player 2 knows this and chooses between D, E, or F.
- If Player 2 chooses F, the game ends.
- If Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1 then chooses between G and H.
- If Player 1 chooses H, the game ends with payoffs (2, -1).
- If Player 1 chooses G, Player 2 chooses between Q and W, with payoffs (3, 3) for Q and (0, 0) for W.
- If Player 1 chooses B or C, Player 2 cannot distinguish between them and chooses between D, E, or F, leading to similar outcomes as when Player 1 chooses A.
