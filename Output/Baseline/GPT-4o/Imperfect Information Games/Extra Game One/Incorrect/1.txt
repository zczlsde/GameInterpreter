Explanation:
- Player 1 starts with actions A, B, or C.
- If Player 1 chooses A, Player 2 knows this and chooses between D, E, and F.
- If Player 2 chooses F, the game ends with a payoff of 0 for both players.
- If Player 2 chooses D or E, Player 1 then chooses between G and H.
- If Player 1 chooses H, the game ends with a payoff of 2 for Player 1 and -1 for Player 2.
- If Player 1 chooses G, Player 2 chooses between Q and W.
- Choosing Q results in a payoff of 3 for both players, while choosing W results in a payoff of 0 for both players.
- If Player 1 chooses B or C, Player 2 cannot distinguish between them and has the same options as when Player 1 chooses A.
