### Explanation:

1. **Chance Node**: The game starts with a chance node where the cards are dealt. There are six possible allocations of the cards, each with a probability of 1/6.

2. **Alice's Decision**: Alice can either "Check" or "Bet". This decision is made without knowing the allocation of the cards.

3. **Bob's Decision**: If Alice checks, Bob can either "Check" or "Bet". Bob makes this decision without knowing Alice's card.

4. **Terminal Nodes**:
   - If both players check, the player with the higher card wins 1 from the other player.
   - If Bob bets and Alice folds, Bob wins the pot of 3.
   - If Bob bets and Alice calls, the player with the higher card wins 2 from the other player.
   - If Alice bets and Bob folds, Alice wins the pot of 3.
   - If Alice bets and Bob calls, the player with the higher card wins 2 from the other player.

The payoffs are structured to reflect the outcomes based on the actions taken by Alice and Bob.
