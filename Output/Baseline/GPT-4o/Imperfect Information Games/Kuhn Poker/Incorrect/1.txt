```

### Explanation:

1. **Chance Node**: The game starts with a chance node where the cards are dealt. There are six possible allocations of the cards, each with a probability of 1/6.

2. **Alice's Decision**: Alice can either "Check" or "Bet". This decision is made without knowing the allocation of the cards.

3. **Bob's Decision after Alice Checks**: If Alice checks, Bob can either "Check" or "Bet". Bob does not know Alice's card.

4. **Terminal Nodes after Bob Checks**: If Bob checks, the game ends, and the player with the higher card wins 1 from the other player.

5. **Alice's Decision after Bob Bets**: If Bob bets, Alice can either "Fold" or "Call". Alice does not know Bob's card.

6. **Terminal Nodes after Alice's Decision**: 
   - If Alice folds, Bob wins the pot of 3.
   - If Alice calls, the game ends, and the player with the higher card wins 2 from the other player.

7. **Bob's Decision after Alice Bets**: If Alice bets, Bob can either "Fold" or "Call". Bob does not know Alice's card.

8. **Terminal Nodes after Bob's Decision**:
   - If Bob folds, Alice wins the pot of 3.
   - If Bob calls, the game ends, and the player with the higher card wins 2 from the other player.

The terminal nodes are repeated for different scenarios where the outcomes are the same, ensuring that the payoffs are consistent with the game description.
