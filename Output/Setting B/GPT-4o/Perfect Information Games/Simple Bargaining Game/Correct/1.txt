### Explanation:

1. **Game Initialization**: We start by creating a new game tree with two players, A and B.

2. **A's Initial Proposal**: A proposes a distribution plan where A gets 5500 and B gets 4500. This is the only action available to A at the start.

3. **B's Decision**: B can either accept or reject A's proposal. If B accepts, the game ends with the proposed distribution, and we set the outcome accordingly.

4. **B's Counter Proposal**: If B rejects, B proposes an equal split of 5000 each. This is the only action available to B after rejecting A's initial proposal.

5. **A's Decision on B's Proposal**: A can either accept or reject B's proposal. If A accepts, the game ends with the equal split, and we set the outcome accordingly.

6. **A's New Proposal**: If A rejects B's proposal, A proposes a new plan where A receives 5200 and B receives 4800. B has no right to reject this proposal, so the game ends with this distribution, and we set the outcome.

7. **Outcome Setting**: We use `g.set_outcome` to define the payoffs for each terminal node in the game tree.

8. **Save the EFG**: Finally, we save the extensive form game representation in the native format.
