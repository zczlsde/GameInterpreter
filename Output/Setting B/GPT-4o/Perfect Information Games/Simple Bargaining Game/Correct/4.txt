### Explanation:

1. **Game Setup**: We start by creating a new game tree with two players, A and B.

2. **A's Initial Proposal**: A proposes a distribution plan where A gets 5500 and B gets 4500. This is the only action available to A at the start.

3. **B's Decision**: B can either accept or reject A's proposal. If B accepts, the game ends with the proposed distribution, and the payoffs are set accordingly.

4. **B's Counter Proposal**: If B rejects, B proposes an equal split of 5000 each. A then decides whether to accept or reject this proposal.

5. **A's Decision on B's Proposal**: If A accepts B's proposal, the game ends with the equal split, and the payoffs are set accordingly.

6. **A's New Proposal**: If A rejects B's proposal, A proposes a new plan where A receives 5200 and B receives 4800. B has no choice but to accept this proposal, and the game ends with the specified payoffs.

7. **Outcome Setting**: The outcomes are set at each terminal node to reflect the final payoffs for both players based on the decisions made during the game.

8. **Save the EFG**: Finally, the extensive form game (EFG) is saved in the native format.
