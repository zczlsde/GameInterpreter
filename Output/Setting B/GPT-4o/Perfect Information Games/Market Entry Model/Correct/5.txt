### Explanation:

1. **Game Setup**: We start by creating a new game tree with two players, "Firm 1" and "Firm 2". The game is titled "Entry Deterrence Game".

2. **Firm 2's Decision**: Firm 2, the potential competitor, makes the first move. It decides whether to "Enter" the market or "Stay Out". This is represented by appending a move to the root node for Firm 2.

3. **Firm 1's Decision**: If Firm 2 chooses to "Enter", Firm 1 must decide whether to "Fight" or "Accommodate". This decision is appended to the node where Firm 2 has chosen to enter.

4. **Payoffs**: We define the payoffs for each possible outcome:
   - If Firm 2 stays out, Firm 1 earns more (payoff of 2), and Firm 2 earns nothing (payoff of 0).
   - If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 accommodates, both firms earn an equal amount (payoff of 1 each).
   - If Firm 2 enters and Firm 1 fights, Firm 2 earns more than Firm 1 (payoff of 2 for Firm 2 and 0 for Firm 1).

5. **Setting Outcomes**: We set the outcomes for each terminal node based on the decisions made by the firms.

6. **Save the EFG**: Finally, we save the extensive form game (EFG) in the native format.
