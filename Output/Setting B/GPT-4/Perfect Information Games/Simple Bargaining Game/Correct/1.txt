```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game tree with players A and B
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["A", "B"], title="Negotiation Game")

# Step 1: A proposes a distribution plan (5500 for A, 4500 for B)
# This is the first move in the game, so it's appended to the root.
g.append_move(g.root, "A", ["Propose 5500-4500"])

# Step 2: B decides whether to accept or reject A's proposal
# This decision is appended as a move for B after A's proposal.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "B", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If B accepts, the game ends with the proposed distribution.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([5500, 4500], label="B Accepts Initial Proposal"))

# If B rejects, B proposes an equal split (5000 each)
# This is B's counter-proposal, so it's appended after B's rejection.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1], "B", ["Propose 5000-5000"])

# Step 3: A decides whether to accept or reject B's equal split proposal
# This decision is appended as a move for A after B's counter-proposal.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], "A", ["Accept", "Reject"])

# If A accepts B's proposal, the game ends with the equal split adjusted to 4750 each due to negotiation costs.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([4750, 4750], label="A Accepts Counter Proposal"))

# If A rejects, A proposes a new plan (5200 for A, 4800 for B) which B must accept.
# This final proposal is appended after A's rejection.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1], "A", ["Propose 5200-4800"])

# Since B has no right to reject, this move directly leads to the final outcome.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([4693, 4332], label="Final Proposal Accepted"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')

This code snippet generates an Extensive Form Game (EFG) for the negotiation game described. The game starts with player A proposing a distribution plan. Depending on B's response, the game can follow different paths, including B's counter-proposal and A's final proposal. The outcomes are set according to the decisions made by the players at each step, reflecting the negotiation process and its costs.
