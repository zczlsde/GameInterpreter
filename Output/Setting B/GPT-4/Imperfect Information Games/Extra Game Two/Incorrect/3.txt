To construct the Extensive Form Game (EFG) for the given game description using the PyGambit library, we'll follow the game's structure closely. The game involves three players and four stages, with some stages involving decisions made without knowledge of previous moves, indicating the need for information sets. Here's how we can approach coding this game:

1. **Stage 1**: Player 1 chooses among actions A, B, and C.
2. **Stage 2**: Player 2 chooses between D and E without knowing Player 1's choice, necessitating an information set.
3. **Stage 3**: After observing Player 2's choice, Player 1 selects between F and G. This implies that Player 1's decision at this stage depends on Player 2's choice, but since Player 2's decision was made without knowledge of Player 1's initial choice, we need to handle this with information sets for Player 2's moves.
4. **Stage 4**: Player 3 decides between Q and W, with the payoffs determined by this final choice.

Given the requirements and the game's structure, here's the Python code using PyGambit to model this game:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Initialize the game with three players
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2", "Player 3"],
                      title="Four Stage Game")

# Stage 1: Player 1's move
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["A", "B", "C"])

# Stage 2: Player 2's move, without knowing Player 1's choice
# We create an information set for Player 2's decision after each of Player 1's choices
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["D", "E"])

# Since Player 2's decision is made without knowledge of Player 1's choice,
# all nodes at this stage belong to the same information set for Player 2
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[0], g.root.children[1].children[0].infoset)
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[2].children[1], g.root.children[1].children[1].infoset)

# Stage 3: Player 1's move, after observing Player 2's choice
# We append moves for Player 1 after each of Player 2's decisions
for child in g.root.children:
    for node in child.children:
        g.append_move(node, "Player 1", ["F", "G"])

# Stage 4: Player 3's decision
# We append moves for Player 3 after each of Player 1's decisions in Stage 3
for child in g.root.children:
    for node in child.children:
        for subnode in node.children:
            g.append_move(subnode, "Player 3", ["Q", "W"])

# Setting outcomes based on Player 3's decision
# If Player 3 selects Q, all players receive a payoff of 3
# If Player 3 selects W, Player 1 and Player 2 each receive a payoff of 2, while Player 3 gets 3
for child in g.root.children:
    for node in child.children:
        for subnode in node.children:
            g.set_outcome(subnode.children[0], g.add_outcome([3, 3, 3], label="All 3"))
            g.set_outcome(subnode.children[1], g.add_outcome([2, 2, 3], label="P1 and P2: 2, P3: 3"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code constructs the game tree step by step, ensuring that information sets are correctly assigned to model the knowledge constraints at each stage. The final payoffs are set according to the game's rules, with different outcomes based on Player 3's choice in the final stage.
