This code snippet creates an extensive form game representing a nuclear crisis scenario between two countries, Country A and Country B. The game starts with Country A deciding whether to escalate a provocation or ignore it. If Country A ignores, both countries receive a small positive payoff, ending the game. If Country A escalates, Country B can either back down, leading to a small payoff for both, or escalate further, leading to a nuclear crisis. In the nuclear crisis, both countries decide simultaneously (modeled as a chance move for equal probabilities) whether to retreat or detonate. The outcomes vary from mutual retreat with small losses, one side winning with the other retreating, to mutual detonation leading to a nuclear disaster with significant losses for both.
