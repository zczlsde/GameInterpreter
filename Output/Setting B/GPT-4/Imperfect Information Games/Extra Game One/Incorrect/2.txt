This code generates the extensive form game (EFG) for the given game description using the PyGambit library. It carefully constructs the game tree, taking into account the information sets to reflect Player 2's inability to distinguish between actions B and C taken by Player 1. It then assigns outcomes based on the final actions taken by the players.
