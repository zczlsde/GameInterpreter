This code snippet constructs the extensive form game (EFG) for the given game description step by step, without using recursion or loops (except for the necessary iteration over specific nodes to append moves and set outcomes). It carefully constructs the game tree, ensuring that information sets are correctly assigned to reflect Player 2's inability to distinguish between actions B and C taken by Player 1. The outcomes are set based on the final actions taken by the players, with specific payoffs assigned to each terminal node.
