To generate the Extensive Form Game (EFG) for the described game using the PyGambit library, we'll follow the game's structure closely. Here's how we can approach coding this game:

1. **Game Setup**: Player 1 (the leader) chooses between "S" and "C". Player 2 (the follower) then interprets Player 1's choice, with a small chance of misinterpretation, and makes their own choice between "S" and "C".

2. **Misinterpretation Chance**: We'll model the chance of misinterpretation as a chance move right after Player 1's decision. This will represent the 1% probability that Player 2 misinterprets Player 1's choice.

3. **Payoffs**: We need to assign values to the payoffs based on the given ranking: E > A > F > W > B > D. For simplicity, let's assign numerical values corresponding to their ranks in descending order: E=6, A=5, F=4, W=3, B=2, D=1.

4. **Implementing the Game in PyGambit**:
   - We start by creating a new game tree.
   - Player 1 makes the initial move.
   - We then create a chance node to model the misinterpretation.
   - Based on the interpretation, Player 2 makes their decision.
   - Finally, we assign the outcomes based on the actual choices of Player 1 and Player 2.

Here's the Python code using PyGambit to model this game:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new game tree
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2"], title="Strategic Misinterpretation Game")

# Player 1's move
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["S", "C"])

# Chance node for misinterpretation after each of Player 1's choices
for node in g.root.children:
    g.append_move(node, g.players.chance, ["Interpreted as S", "Interpreted as C"])
    # Setting the chance probabilities: 99% correct interpretation, 1% misinterpretation
    g.set_chance_probs(node.infoset, [gbt.Rational(99, 100), gbt.Rational(1, 100)])

# Player 2's decisions based on interpretation
for node in g.root.children:
    for chance_node in node.children:
        g.append_move(chance_node, "Player 2", ["S", "C"])

# Assigning payoffs based on the actual choices of Player 1 and not the interpretation
# Payoffs: E=6, A=5, F=4, W=3, B=2, D=1
# If both choose S
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([5, 2]))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([5, 2]))
# If Player 1 chooses S and Player 2 chooses C
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([3, 1]))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([3, 1]))
# If Player 1 chooses C and Player 2 chooses S
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([6, 3]))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([6, 3]))
# If both choose C
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([4, 4]))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([4, 4]))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code models the game as described, including the chance of misinterpretation and the resulting payoffs based on the actual choices of Player 1 and Player 2.
