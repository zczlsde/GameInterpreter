To generate the Extensive Form Game (EFG) for this scenario using the PyGambit library, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Define the game structure**: Player 1 (the leader) chooses between "S" and "C" first. Then, there's a chance move representing the probability of misinterpretation by Player 2 (the follower). Finally, Player 2 chooses between "S" and "C" based on their interpretation.

2. **Assign payoff values**: We need to assign concrete values to the payoffs (E, A, F, W, B, D) based on their ranking. Let's assign E=6, A=5, F=4, W=3, B=2, D=1 to reflect their ranking from highest to lowest.

3. **Implement chance moves**: We'll represent the small probability of misinterpretation as a chance move with probabilities for correct and incorrect interpretation.

4. **Set outcomes**: Based on the actual choices of Player 1 and Player 2, we'll set the outcomes according to the given payoff structure.

Here's how the code could look:

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Initialize the game
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2"], title="Leader-Follower Game with Misinterpretation")

# Step 2: Player 1's move
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["S", "C"])

# Step 3: Chance node for misinterpretation after Player 1 chooses "S"
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], g.players.chance, ["Interpreted as S", "Misinterpreted as C"])
# Setting the probabilities for correct interpretation and misinterpretation
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.children[0].infoset, [gbt.Rational(99, 100), gbt.Rational(1, 100)])

# Step 4: Chance node for misinterpretation after Player 1 chooses "C"
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], g.players.chance, ["Misinterpreted as S", "Interpreted as C"])
# Setting the probabilities for misinterpretation and correct interpretation
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.children[1].infoset, [gbt.Rational(1, 100), gbt.Rational(99, 100)])

# Step 5: Player 2's moves based on their interpretation
# For each interpretation of Player 1's action "S"
for node in g.root.children[0].children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["S", "C"])

# For each interpretation of Player 1's action "C"
for node in g.root.children[1].children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["S", "C"])

# Step 6: Assigning payoffs based on the actual choices of Player 1 and Player 2
# Payoffs when Player 1 chooses "S"
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([5, 2], label="SS"))  # Both choose S
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([3, 1], label="SC"))  # S then C
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([5, 2], label="SS"))  # Both choose S (misinterpretation doesn't change the actual choice)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([3, 1], label="SC"))  # S then C

# Payoffs when Player 1 chooses "C"
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([6, 3], label="CS"))  # C then S
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([4, 4], label="CC"))  # Both choose C
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([6, 3], label="CS"))  # C then S
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([4, 4], label="CC"))  # Both choose C

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code snippet creates a game tree where Player 1 makes the initial decision, followed by a chance node to account for the possibility of misinterpretation by Player 2, and finally, Player 2 makes a decision based on their interpretation. The payoffs are assigned according to the actual choices of Player 1 and Player 2, reflecting the given payoff structure.
