To generate the Extensive Form Game (EFG) for the described game using the PyGambit library, we'll follow the game's structure closely. Given the game's description, we'll first define the payoffs for each outcome based on the ranking provided (E > A > F > W > B > D). Then, we'll construct the game tree, taking into account the chance node for misinterpretation by Player 2.

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Assign values to payoffs based on their ranking
# E (highest), A, F, W, B, D (lowest)
E, A, F, W, B, D = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

# Create a new game tree
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2"], title="Strategic Misinterpretation Game")

# Player 1's move: choosing between "S" and "C"
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["S", "C"])

# Chance node for misinterpretation by Player 2
# If Player 1 chooses S, 1% chance Player 2 perceives it as C, and vice versa
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], g.players.chance, ["Perceived S", "Perceived C"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], g.players.chance, ["Perceived S", "Perceived C"])

# Set the probabilities for the chance nodes
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.children[0].infoset, [gbt.Rational(99, 100), gbt.Rational(1, 100)])
g.set_chance_probs(g.root.children[1].infoset, [gbt.Rational(1, 100), gbt.Rational(99, 100)])

# Player 2's moves based on the interpretation
for node in g.root.children[0].children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["S", "C"])
for node in g.root.children[1].children:
    g.append_move(node, "Player 2", ["S", "C"])

# Define outcomes based on Player 1's actual choice and Player 2's response
# Player 1 chooses S
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([A, B], label="SS"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([W, D], label="SC"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([A, B], label="SS"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([W, D], label="SC"))

# Player 1 chooses C
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([E, W], label="CS"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([F, F], label="CC"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([E, W], label="CS"))
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([F, F], label="CC"))

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
```

This code snippet constructs the game tree for the described game, incorporating the chance of misinterpretation by Player 2. The game starts with Player 1's choice between "S" and "C". Then, a chance node represents the possibility of misinterpretation by Player 2, with probabilities set for accurate and inaccurate perceptions. Based on what Player 2 perceives Player 1's choice to be, Player 2 then makes a decision between "S" and "C". The outcomes are determined by Player 1's actual choice and Player 2's response, with payoffs assigned accordingly.
