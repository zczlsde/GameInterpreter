```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, each with two actions: "Gourmet Heaven" and "Urban Buzz".

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# The game is simultaneous because both partners choose their preferred location without knowing the other's choice.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume one partner moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is the first partner's decision node.
# The second partner's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the first partner's actions.

# Step 5: Group the decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the partners move simultaneously, the second partner does not know the first partner's choice.
# Therefore, the second partner's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# The players are "Fine Dining Lover" and "Cafe Enthusiast".
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Fine Dining Lover", "Cafe Enthusiast"],

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume "Fine Dining Lover" moves first and "Cafe Enthusiast" moves second.

# Step 3: Define the actions for the first player, "Fine Dining Lover".
# The actions are "Gourmet Heaven" and "Urban Buzz".
g.append_move(g.root, "Fine Dining Lover", ["Gourmet Heaven", "Urban Buzz"])

# Step 4: Define the actions for the second player, "Cafe Enthusiast".
# The actions are also "Gourmet Heaven" and "Urban Buzz".
# These actions are appended to the decision nodes of the first player's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Cafe Enthusiast", ["Gourmet Heaven", "Urban Buzz"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Cafe Enthusiast", ["Gourmet Heaven", "Urban Buzz"])

# Step 5: Set the outcomes for each possible combination of actions.
# If both choose "Gourmet Heaven", the payoffs are [2, 1].
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both at Gourmet Heaven"))

# If "Fine Dining Lover" chooses "Gourmet Heaven" and "Cafe Enthusiast" chooses "Urban Buzz", the payoffs are [0, 0].
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Split Locations"))

# If "Fine Dining Lover" chooses "Urban Buzz" and "Cafe Enthusiast" chooses "Gourmet Heaven", the payoffs are [0, 0].
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Split Locations"))

# If both choose "Urban Buzz", the payoffs are [1, 2].
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both at Urban Buzz"))

# Step 6: Group the decision nodes of the second player in the same information set.
# This reflects the simultaneous nature of the game, where the second player does not know the first player's choice.
