```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, both deciding simultaneously on the vacation location.
# Each player has two actions: choose Disneyland or choose Yellowstone.

# Step 2: Recognize the imperfect information.
# Since the players decide simultaneously, neither player knows the other's choice at the time of their decision.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume one player moves first, and the other moves second, but the second player does not know the first player's choice.

# Step 4: Define the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the first player.
# The second player's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the first player's actions.

# Step 5: Group the second player's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the second player cannot distinguish between the first player's actions, these nodes should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Sibling1", "Sibling2"],
                      title="Family Vacation Decision Game")

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Sibling1 moves first, and Sibling2 moves second, but Sibling2 does not know Sibling1's choice.

# Step 3: Define the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for Sibling1.
# Sibling1 has two actions: choose Disneyland or choose Yellowstone.
g.append_move(g.root, "Sibling1", ["Disneyland", "Yellowstone"])

# Step 4: Define the decision nodes for Sibling2.
# Sibling2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to Sibling1's actions.
# Sibling2 also has two actions: choose Disneyland or choose Yellowstone.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Sibling2", ["Disneyland", "Yellowstone"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Sibling2", ["Disneyland", "Yellowstone"])

# Step 5: Group Sibling2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Sibling2 cannot distinguish between Sibling1's actions, these nodes should be in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 6: Define the outcomes based on the choices of both siblings.
# If both choose Disneyland, the amusement park fan earns 2 points, and the nature lover gets 1 point.
# If both choose Yellowstone, the nature enthusiast gets 2 points, and the thrill-seeker gets 1 point.
# If they choose different places, they don't have a family vacation, both scoring 0 points.

# Outcome for both choosing Disneyland
outcome_disneyland = g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Disneyland")
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], outcome_disneyland)

# Outcome for both choosing Yellowstone
outcome_yellowstone = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Yellowstone")
