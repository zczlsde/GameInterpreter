# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: Employee and Employer.
# Both players have two actions: Compromise and Hold Firm.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since both players move simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# To model the game with a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 3: Define the decision nodes.
# Let's assume the Employer moves first and the Employee moves second.
# The starting node, g.root, is the Employer's decision node.
# The Employer has two actions: Compromise and Hold Firm.
# The Employee's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to the Employer's actions.

# Step 4: Group the Employee's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the Employee does not know which action the Employer has taken, the Employee's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
