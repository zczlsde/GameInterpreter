# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, Nation 1 and Nation 2. They must decide simultaneously whether to exchange spies or not.

# Step 2: Recognize the imperfect information.
# Since the players make their decisions simultaneously, neither player knows the other's decision at the time of making their own decision.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Nation 1 moves first and Nation 2 moves second. This is a common way to model simultaneous moves in a sequential game.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is Nation 1's decision node.
# Nation 1 has two actions: Agree or Not agree.
# Nation 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Nation 1's actions Agree and Not agree.

# Step 5: Group Nation 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Nation 2 does not know Nation 1's action when making its decision, Nation 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure to represent simultaneous moves.
# Assume Nation 1 moves first and Nation 2 moves second.

# Step 3: Nation 1's decision node is the root of the game tree.
# Nation 1 has two actions: Agree or Not agree.
g.append_move(g.root, "Nation 1", ["Agree", "Not agree"])

# Step 4: Nation 2's decision nodes are based on Nation 1's actions.
# Nation 2 has two decision nodes, corresponding to Nation 1's actions.
# Nation 2 also has two actions: Agree or Not agree.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Nation 2", ["Agree", "Not agree"])

# Since Nation 2 does not know Nation 1's action when making its decision,
# Nation 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Step 6: Define the outcomes for each possible combination of actions.
# Both agree: regain spies, mutual respect.

# Nation 1 does not agree, Nation 2 agrees: Nation 2 feels duped, Nation 1 gains advantage.

# Neither agrees: spies remain in captivity, escalating hostilities.
outcome_escalation = g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Escalation")
