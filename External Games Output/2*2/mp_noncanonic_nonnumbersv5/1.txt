```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the new designer and the established designer.
# Both players have two actions: showcase a classical collection or an avant-garde collection.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since the designers choose independently, this is a simultaneous move game.
# To model it sequentially, assume one designer moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the first designer.
# The second designer's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the first designer's actions.

# Step 4: Determine the information sets.
# The second designer does not know the first designer's choice when making their decision.
# Therefore, the second designer's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the second designer's decision nodes.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the new designer and the established designer.
# Both players have two actions: showcase a classical collection or an avant-garde collection.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since the designers choose independently, this is a simultaneous move game.
# To model it sequentially, assume the new designer moves first and the established designer moves second.

# Step 3: Create the game tree.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["New Designer", "Established Designer"],
                      title="Fashion Week Showcase Game")

# Step 4: Append moves for the new designer.
# The new designer makes the first move at the root node.
g.append_move(g.root, "New Designer", ["Classical", "Avant-garde"])

# Step 5: Append moves for the established designer.
# The established designer makes a move after the new designer.
# The established designer's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1],
# corresponding to the new designer's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Established Designer", ["Classical", "Avant-garde"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Established Designer", ["Classical", "Avant-garde"])

# Step 6: Determine the information sets.
# The established designer does not know the new designer's choice when making their decision.
# Therefore, the established designer's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the established designer's decision nodes.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 7: Define the outcomes.
# If their choices match, the new designer gains attention and acclaim.
# If they differ, the established designer reaffirms their position.

# Outcomes when choices match
new_designer_gains = g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="New Designer Gains")
# Outcomes when choices differ
established_designer_reaffirms = g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Established Designer Reaffirms")

# Step 8: Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
# Matching choices
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], new_designer_gains)  # Both choose Classical
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], new_designer_gains)  # Both choose Avant-garde

# Differing choices
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], established_designer_reaffirms)  # New: Classical, Established: Avant-garde
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], established_designer_reaffirms)  # New: Avant-garde, Established: Classical
