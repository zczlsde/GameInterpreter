```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# In the Battle of the Sexes game, both players (the couple) choose simultaneously between Opera and Football.

# Step 2: Represent the game in a sequential structure.
# Assume one player moves first and the other moves second to model the simultaneous move.

# Step 3: Determine the decision nodes for each player.
# The first player's decision node is the root. The second player's decision nodes are the children of the root.

# Step 4: Identify the imperfect information.
# Since the players move simultaneously, the second player does not know the first player's choice.

# Step 5: Group the second player's decision nodes in the same information set.
# This reflects the imperfect information where the second player cannot distinguish between the first player's actions.

# Set the information set for the second player's decision nodes.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players, Opera Lover and Football Lover.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Opera Lover", "Football Lover"],
                      title="Battle of the Sexes")

# Step 2: Represent the game in a sequential structure.
# Assume Opera Lover moves first and Football Lover moves second to model the simultaneous move.

# Step 3: Add moves for the Opera Lover at the root node.
g.append_move(g.root, "Opera Lover", ["Opera", "Football"])

# Step 4: Add moves for the Football Lover at the children of the root node.
# These represent the decision nodes for the Football Lover.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Football Lover", ["Opera", "Football"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Football Lover", ["Opera", "Football"])

# Step 5: Set the information set for the Football Lover's decision nodes.
# This reflects the imperfect information where the Football Lover cannot distinguish between the Opera Lover's actions.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 6: Define the outcomes for each possible combination of actions.
opera_opera = g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Opera")
football_football = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Football")
different_events = g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Different events")

# Step 7: Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], opera_opera)  # Both choose Opera
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], different_events)  # Opera Lover chooses Opera, Football Lover chooses Football
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], different_events)  # Opera Lover chooses Football, Football Lover chooses Opera
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], football_football)  # Both choose Football
