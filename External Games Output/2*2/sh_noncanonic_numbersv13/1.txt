```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, both generals, who must decide whether to launch an attack or hesitate.

# Step 2: Determine the nature of the game.
# The game involves simultaneous decision-making, which means there is imperfect information.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume one general moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The first general's decision node is g.root.
# The second general's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the first general's actions (attack or hesitate).

# Step 5: Group the decision nodes into information sets.
# Since the generals move simultaneously, the second general does not know the first general's action.
# Therefore, the second general's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["General 1", "General 2"],
                      title="Two Generals' Coordination Game")

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume General 1 moves first and General 2 moves second.

# Step 3: General 1 makes the first move with two actions: Attack or Hesitate.
g.append_move(g.root, "General 1", ["Attack", "Hesitate"])

# Step 4: General 2 makes a move after General 1, with the same two actions: Attack or Hesitate.
# General 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to General 1's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "General 2", ["Attack", "Hesitate"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "General 2", ["Attack", "Hesitate"])

# Step 5: Group the decision nodes into information sets to reflect simultaneous decision-making.
# Since the generals move simultaneously, General 2 does not know General 1's action.
# Therefore, General 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 6: Define the outcomes based on the actions taken by both generals.
# If both generals attack, they each gain 9 points.

# If General 1 attacks and General 2 hesitates, General 1 gains 0 points and General 2 gains 4 points.

g1_hesitates_g2_attacks = g.add_outcome([4, 0], label="G1 Hesitates, G2 Attacks")

# If both generals hesitate, they each gain 2 points.
both_hesitate = g.add_outcome([2, 2], label="Both Hesitate")

# Step 7: Assign the outcomes to the terminal nodes of the game tree.
