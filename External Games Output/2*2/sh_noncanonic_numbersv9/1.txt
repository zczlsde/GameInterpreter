# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two logging companies, which we can consider as two players.
# Each player has two actions: adopt sustainable practices or not.

# Step 2: Determine the nature of the game.
# The game is simultaneous because both companies decide their actions without knowing the other's choice.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume one company moves first and the other moves second to represent the simultaneous nature.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The first company's decision node is the root.
# The second company's decision nodes are the children of the root, corresponding to the first company's actions.

# Step 5: Group the decision nodes of the second company in the same information set.
# Since the second company does not know the first company's action, its decision nodes should be in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the second company's decision nodes.
