# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, Organization 1 and Organization 2.
# Both players have two actions: Collaborate or Work Independently.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since the players' decisions are made simultaneously, this involves imperfect information.
# To model this with a sequential structure, assume Organization 1 moves first and Organization 2 moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is Organization 1's decision node.
# Organization 1 has two actions, Collaborate and Work Independently.
# Organization 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Organization 1's actions Collaborate and Work Independently.

# Step 4: Group the decision nodes into information sets.
# Organization 2, moving simultaneously, does not know which action Organization 1 has taken.
# Therefore, Organization 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
