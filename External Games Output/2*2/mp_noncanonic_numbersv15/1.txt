```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the small sports apparel company and the large multinational sports brand.
# Both players decide independently and simultaneously whether to sponsor a soccer tournament or a basketball tournament.

# Step 2: Determine the imperfect information structure.
# Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, neither player knows the other's choice at the time of making their decision.
# To model this in a sequential structure, we can assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# However, the second player does not know the first player's choice, so their decision nodes must be in the same information set.

# Step 3: Set the information set for the second player.
# Assume the large multinational sports brand moves first and the small sports apparel company moves second.
# The small sports apparel company has two decision nodes corresponding to the large brand's choices.
# These nodes should be grouped in the same information set because the small company does not know the large brand's choice.

# Set the information set for the small sports apparel company's decision nodes.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Small Company and Large Brand.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Small Company", "Large Brand"],
                      title="Sponsorship Game")

# Step 2: Model the simultaneous decision-making process.
# We assume the Large Brand moves first and the Small Company moves second.
# However, the Small Company does not know the Large Brand's choice, so their decision nodes must be in the same information set.

# Step 3: Add moves for the Large Brand.
# The Large Brand can choose to sponsor either a Soccer or Basketball tournament.
g.append_move(g.root, "Large Brand", ["Soccer", "Basketball"])

# Step 4: Add moves for the Small Company.
# The Small Company can also choose to sponsor either a Soccer or Basketball tournament.
# These moves are added to the nodes resulting from the Large Brand's choices.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Small Company", ["Soccer", "Basketball"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Small Company", ["Soccer", "Basketball"])

# Step 5: Set the information set for the Small Company's decision nodes.
# Since the Small Company does not know the Large Brand's choice, the decision nodes must be in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 6: Define the outcomes based on the players' choices.
# If both choose the same sport, the Small Company wins 3 points, and the Large Brand loses 3 points.
# If their choices differ, the Large Brand wins 5 points, and the Small Company loses 5 points.

# Outcomes when both choose the same sport.
same_sport_outcome = g.add_outcome([3, -3], label="Same Sport")

# Outcomes when they choose different sports.
different_sport_outcome = g.add_outcome([-5, 5], label="Different Sport")

# Step 7: Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
# Large Brand chooses Soccer, Small Company chooses Soccer
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], same_sport_outcome)

# Large Brand chooses Soccer, Small Company chooses Basketball
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], different_sport_outcome)
