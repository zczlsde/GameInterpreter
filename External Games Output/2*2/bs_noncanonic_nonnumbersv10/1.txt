```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, Roommate 1 and Roommate 2, who are deciding simultaneously between two actions: Italian or Japanese.

# Step 2: Recognize the simultaneous nature of the game.
# Since both players are deciding simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Roommate 1 moves first and Roommate 2 moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes for Roommate 2.
# Roommate 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Italian) and g.root.children[1] (Japanese).

# Step 5: Group Roommate 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Roommate 2 cannot distinguish between Roommate 1 choosing Italian or Japanese, so these nodes should be in the same information set.

# Assume Roommate 1 moves first and Roommate 2 moves second.

# Step 3: Roommate 1 has two actions: Italian or Japanese.
