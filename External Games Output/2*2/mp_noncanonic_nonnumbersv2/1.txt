```python
# Step 1: Both the startup and the major tech corporation make their decisions simultaneously.
# Step 2: To model this as a sequential game, assume the major tech corporation moves first, and the startup moves second.
# Step 3: The starting node, g.root, is the major tech corporation's decision node.
# Step 4: The major tech corporation has two actions: develop product A or product B.
# Step 5: The startup's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (if the corporation develops product A) and g.root.children[1] (if the corporation develops product B).
# Step 6: Since the startup does not know which product the corporation has chosen to develop, the startup's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: the startup and the major tech corporation.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Startup", "Major Tech Corporation"],
                      title="Product Development Game")

# Step 1: Model the game as a sequential game where the major tech corporation moves first.
# The major tech corporation has two actions: develop product A or product B.
g.append_move(g.root, "Major Tech Corporation", ["Develop A", "Develop B"])

# Step 2: The startup makes its decision after the major tech corporation.
# The startup's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (if the corporation develops product A)
# and g.root.children[1] (if the corporation develops product B).
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Startup", ["Develop A", "Develop B"])

# Step 3: Since the startup does not know which product the corporation has chosen to develop,
# the startup's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
# Use the provided code to handle the imperfect information.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 4: Define the outcomes based on the players' choices.
# If both develop the same product, the startup profits and the corporation loses market share.
# If their choices differ, the corporation profits by dominating the market segment.

# Outcomes when both develop the same product

# Both develop A

# Startup develops A, Corporation develops B
