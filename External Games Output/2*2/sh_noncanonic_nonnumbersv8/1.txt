# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two directors, Director 1 and Director 2.
# Each director has two actions: Collaborate on the joint project or Work on their own film.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since the directors make their decisions simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# To model the game with a sequential structure, assume Director 1 moves first and Director 2 moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is Director 1's decision node.
# Director 1 has two actions: Collaborate or Work on their own film.
# Director 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Director 1's actions.

# Step 4: Group the decision nodes into information sets.
# Director 2, moving simultaneously, does not know which action Director 1 has taken.
# Therefore, Director 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
