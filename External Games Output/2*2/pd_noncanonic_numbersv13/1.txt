# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. This is a simultaneous move game where both countries decide independently whether to implement pollution controls.
# 2. Since both countries make their decisions simultaneously, neither country knows the decision of the other at the time of making their own decision.
# 3. To model this in a sequential structure, we can assume one country moves first and the other moves second.
# 4. The first country's decision node is the root, and the second country's decision nodes are the children of the root.
# 5. The second country, moving simultaneously, does not know which action the first country has taken.
# 6. Therefore, the second country's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming Country 1 moves first and Country 2 moves second:
# Country 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to Country 1's actions (implement or not implement).
# Since Country 2 cannot distinguish between these nodes, they should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
