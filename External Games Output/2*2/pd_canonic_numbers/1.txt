```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, Suspect 1 and Suspect 2, who can either "Confess" or "Remain Silent".

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# The game is simultaneous, meaning both players make their decisions without knowing the other's choice.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Suspect 1 moves first and Suspect 2 moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is Suspect 1's decision node.
# Suspect 1 has two actions, "Confess" and "Remain Silent".
# Suspect 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (if Suspect 1 confesses) and g.root.children[1] (if Suspect 1 remains silent).

# Step 5: Group Suspect 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Suspect 2 does not know Suspect 1's action, Suspect 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Suspect 1", "Suspect 2"], title="Prisoner's Dilemma")

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Suspect 1 moves first and Suspect 2 moves second.

# Step 3: Suspect 1's decision node is the root of the game tree.
# Suspect 1 has two actions: "Confess" and "Remain Silent".
g.append_move(g.root, "Suspect 1", ["Confess", "Remain Silent"])

# Step 4: Suspect 2's decision nodes are based on Suspect 1's actions.
# If Suspect 1 confesses, Suspect 2's decision node is g.root.children[0].
# If Suspect 1 remains silent, Suspect 2's decision node is g.root.children[1].
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Suspect 2", ["Confess", "Remain Silent"])

# Since Suspect 2 does not know Suspect 1's action, Suspect 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Step 6: Define the outcomes for each possible combination of actions.
# If both suspects confess, they each receive a moderate sentence of 5 years.
both_confess = g.add_outcome([-5, -5], label="Both Confess")

# If both suspects remain silent, they each receive a minor sentence of 1 year.
both_silent = g.add_outcome([-1, -1], label="Both Silent")

# Step 7: Assign the outcomes to the terminal nodes.
