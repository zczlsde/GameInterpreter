```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# In the Battle of the Sexes game, both players (the couple) choose simultaneously between two actions: Opera and Football.

# Step 2: Determine the imperfect information structure.
# Since the players move simultaneously, neither player knows the other's choice when making their decision.
# To model this in a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# The second player, when making their decision, does not know the first player's choice.

# Step 3: Set the information set for the second player.
# Assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Player 1 chooses Opera) and g.root.children[1] (Player 1 chooses Football).
# Since Player 2 cannot distinguish between these nodes when making their decision, they should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Opera Lover and Football Lover.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Opera Lover", "Football Lover"],
                      title="Battle of the Sexes")

# Step 2: Model the game as a sequential game to handle simultaneous moves.
# Assume Opera Lover moves first and Football Lover moves second.

# Step 3: Opera Lover chooses between Opera and Football.
g.append_move(g.root, "Opera Lover", ["Opera", "Football"])

# Step 4: Football Lover makes a decision without knowing Opera Lover's choice.
# Football Lover also chooses between Opera and Football.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Football Lover", ["Opera", "Football"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Football Lover", ["Opera", "Football"])

# Step 5: Set the information set for Football Lover to reflect imperfect information.
# Football Lover cannot distinguish between the nodes where Opera Lover chose Opera or Football.
# Use the provided code block to set the information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 6: Define the payoffs for each outcome.
# If both choose Opera, Opera Lover gets a higher payoff.
opera_opera_outcome = g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Opera")
# If both choose Football, Football Lover gets a higher payoff.
football_football_outcome = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Football")
# If they choose different events, both get no payoff.
different_outcome = g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Different choices")

# Step 7: Assign the outcomes to the terminal nodes.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], opera_opera_outcome)  # Both choose Opera
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], different_outcome)    # Opera Lover chooses Opera, Football Lover chooses Football
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], different_outcome)    # Opera Lover chooses Football, Football Lover chooses Opera
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], football_football_outcome)  # Both choose Football
