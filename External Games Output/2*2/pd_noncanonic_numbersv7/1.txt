```python
# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. This is a simultaneous move game where both nations decide at the same time whether to build or disarm.
# 2. To model this game with a sequential structure, assume one nation moves first and the other moves second.
# 3. The starting node, g.root, is the first nation's decision node.
# 4. The first nation has two actions: Build or Disarm.
# 5. The second nation's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (if the first nation builds) and g.root.children[1] (if the first nation disarms).
# 6. Since the second nation cannot know the first nation's action when making its decision, these nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the second nation's decision nodes
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Nation 1 and Nation 2
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Nation 1", "Nation 2"],
                      title="Cold War Nuclear Arms Decision Game")

# Step 1: Model the game as a sequential game where Nation 1 moves first
# Nation 1 has two actions: Build or Disarm
g.append_move(g.root, "Nation 1", ["Build", "Disarm"])

# Step 2: Nation 2 moves after Nation 1
# Nation 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (if Nation 1 builds) and g.root.children[1] (if Nation 1 disarms)
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Nation 2", ["Build", "Disarm"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Nation 2", ["Build", "Disarm"])

# Step 3: Set the information set for Nation 2's decision nodes
# Since Nation 2 cannot know Nation 1's action when making its decision, these nodes should be grouped in the same information set
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 4: Define the outcomes for each possible combination of actions
# If both build arsenals, each receives a payoff of 4
outcome_both_build = g.add_outcome([4, 4], label="Both Build")

# If Nation 1 builds and Nation 2 disarms, Nation 1 receives 7 and Nation 2 receives 1
outcome_n1_build_n2_disarm = g.add_outcome([7, 1], label="N1 Builds, N2 Disarms")

# If Nation 1 disarms and Nation 2 builds, Nation 1 receives 1 and Nation 2 receives 7
outcome_n1_disarm_n2_build = g.add_outcome([1, 7], label="N1 Disarms, N2 Builds")

# If both disarm, each receives a payoff of 6
outcome_both_disarm = g.add_outcome([6, 6], label="Both Disarm")

# Step 5: Assign outcomes to the terminal nodes
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], outcome_both_build)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], outcome_n1_build_n2_disarm)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], outcome_n1_disarm_n2_build)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], outcome_both_disarm)

# Save the EFG
