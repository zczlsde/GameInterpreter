# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two startups, which we can consider as two players.
# Each startup has two actions: Collaborate or Go it alone.

# Step 2: Determine the sequence of moves.
# Since the startups make their decisions simultaneously, we need to model this with imperfect information.
# We can assume one startup moves first and the other moves second, but the second startup does not know the first startup's action.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes and information sets.
# The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the first startup.
# The first startup has two actions, Collaborate and Go it alone.
# The second startup's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the first startup's actions.
# Since the second startup does not know the first startup's action, its decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Step 4: Set the information set for the second startup's decision nodes.
