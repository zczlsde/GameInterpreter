# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two political parties, each deciding whether to commit to a coalition or pursue their agenda independently.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# The game is simultaneous because both parties decide at the same time whether to commit or not.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Party 1 moves first and Party 2 moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is Party 1's decision node.
# Party 1 has two actions: Commit or Not Commit.
# Party 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to Party 1's actions Commit and Not Commit.

# Step 5: Determine the information set for Party 2.
# Since Party 2 moves simultaneously with Party 1, Party 2 does not know which action Party 1 has taken.
# Therefore, Party 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for Party 2's decision nodes.
