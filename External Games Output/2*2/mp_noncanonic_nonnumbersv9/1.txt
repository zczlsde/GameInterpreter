# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the independent film studio and the major Hollywood studio.
# Both players decide independently whether to release their film on a holiday weekend or a regular weekend.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since both players decide independently, this is a simultaneous move game.
# To model it sequentially, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 3: Define the decision nodes.
# Assume the independent film studio moves first, and the major Hollywood studio moves second.
# The independent film studio's decision node is the root node (g.root).
# The major Hollywood studio's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the independent film studio's actions (holiday or regular).

# Step 4: Identify the imperfect information.
# The major Hollywood studio does not know the independent film studio's decision when making its own decision.
# Therefore, the major Hollywood studio's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Step 5: Set the information set for the major Hollywood studio's decision nodes.
