# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two chefs, Chef 1 and Chef 2, who can either Collaborate or Work Independently.

# Step 2: Determine the nature of the game.
# The game involves simultaneous moves, which means there is imperfect information.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Chef 1 moves first and Chef 2 moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is Chef 1's decision node.
# Chef 1 has two actions: Collaborate and Work Independently.
# Chef 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to Chef 1's actions.

# Step 5: Group Chef 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Chef 2 does not know Chef 1's action, Chef 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
