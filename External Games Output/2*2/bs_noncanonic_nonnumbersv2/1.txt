```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, the Tech Enthusiast and the Market Trends Enthusiast.
# Both players have two actions: attend the Technology Conference or attend the Market Trends Seminar.

# Step 2: Determine the nature of the game.
# The game is simultaneous because both players decide independently and without knowledge of the other's choice.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume one player moves first and the other moves second to represent the simultaneous nature.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the first player (e.g., Tech Enthusiast).
# The second player's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the first player's actions.

# Step 5: Group the decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the second player (Market Trends Enthusiast) does not know the first player's action, their decision nodes should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Tech Enthusiast and Market Trends Enthusiast.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Tech Enthusiast", "Market Trends Enthusiast"],
                      title="Conference vs Seminar Decision Game")

# Step 2: Model the game as a sequential game to represent simultaneous decisions.
# Assume the Tech Enthusiast moves first.
g.append_move(g.root, "Tech Enthusiast", ["Technology Conference", "Market Trends Seminar"])

# Step 3: The Market Trends Enthusiast moves second, but their decision is simultaneous with the Tech Enthusiast.
# Therefore, we add moves for the Market Trends Enthusiast at both nodes resulting from the Tech Enthusiast's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Market Trends Enthusiast", ["Technology Conference", "Market Trends Seminar"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Market Trends Enthusiast", ["Technology Conference", "Market Trends Seminar"])

# Step 4: Set the information set for the Market Trends Enthusiast to reflect the simultaneous nature of the game.
# The Market Trends Enthusiast does not know the Tech Enthusiast's action when making their decision.
# Use the provided code block to set the information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the payoffs for each outcome.
# Both choose Technology Conference: Tech Enthusiast gets higher payoff, Market Trends Enthusiast gets lower payoff.
tech_enthusiast_high = g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Technology Conference")
# Both choose Market Trends Seminar: Market Trends Enthusiast gets higher payoff, Tech Enthusiast gets lower payoff.
market_trends_enthusiast_high = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Market Trends Seminar")
# Different choices: Both get no payoff.
no_payoff = g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Different choices")

# Step 6: Assign the outcomes to the terminal nodes.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], tech_enthusiast_high)  # Both choose Technology Conference
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], no_payoff)  # Different choices
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], no_payoff)  # Different choices
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], market_trends_enthusiast_high)  # Both choose Market Trends Seminar
