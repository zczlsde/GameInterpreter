```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, both deciding simultaneously between two actions: Action Movie or Romantic Comedy.

# Step 2: Since the players move simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# To model the game with a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 3: Assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Player 1's actions (Action Movie and Romantic Comedy).

# Step 4: Since Player 2 does not know which action Player 1 has taken, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for Player 2's decision nodes.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Movie Buff 1 and Movie Buff 2.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Movie Buff 1", "Movie Buff 2"],
                      title="Movie Selection Game")

# Step 2: Movie Buff 1 moves first and chooses between "Action Movie" and "Romantic Comedy".
g.append_move(g.root, "Movie Buff 1", ["Action Movie", "Romantic Comedy"])

# Step 3: Movie Buff 2 moves second and also chooses between "Action Movie" and "Romantic Comedy".
# Movie Buff 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Movie Buff 1's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Movie Buff 2", ["Action Movie", "Romantic Comedy"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Movie Buff 2", ["Action Movie", "Romantic Comedy"])

# Step 4: Since Movie Buff 2 does not know which action Movie Buff 1 has taken, Movie Buff 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
# Set the information set for Movie Buff 2's decision nodes.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the payoffs for each outcome.
# If both choose "Action Movie", Movie Buff 1 gets a higher payoff, Movie Buff 2 gets a lower payoff.
action_movie_outcome = g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Action Movie")

# If both choose "Romantic Comedy", Movie Buff 2 gets a higher payoff, Movie Buff 1 gets a lower payoff.
romantic_comedy_outcome = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Romantic Comedy")

# If they choose different movies, they both get no payoff.
no_payoff_outcome = g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Different Movies")

# Step 6: Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], action_movie_outcome)  # Both choose Action Movie
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], no_payoff_outcome)     # Different Movies
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], no_payoff_outcome)     # Different Movies
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], romantic_comedy_outcome)  # Both choose Romantic Comedy
