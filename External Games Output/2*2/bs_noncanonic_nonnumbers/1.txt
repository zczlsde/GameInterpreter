```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, and they are deciding simultaneously between two options: Elegance Boutique and Chic Couture.

# Step 2: Since the players move simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# To model the game with a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 3: The starting node, g.root, is the first player's decision node.
# The first player has two actions, Elegance Boutique and Chic Couture.

# Step 4: The second player's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to the first player's actions Elegance Boutique and Chic Couture.

# Step 5: The second player, moving simultaneously, does not know which action the first player has taken.
# Therefore, the second player's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the second player's decision nodes.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players.
# We will name the players "Player 1" and "Player 2".
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Player 1", "Player 2"],
                      title="Shopping Decision Game")

# Step 2: Model the game as a sequential game to handle simultaneous moves.
# Assume Player 1 moves first, choosing between "Elegance Boutique" and "Chic Couture".
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["Elegance Boutique", "Chic Couture"])

# Step 3: Player 2 moves next, but does not know Player 1's choice.
# Player 2 also chooses between "Elegance Boutique" and "Chic Couture".
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Player 2", ["Elegance Boutique", "Chic Couture"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Player 2", ["Elegance Boutique", "Chic Couture"])

# Step 4: Set the information set for Player 2's decision nodes to reflect imperfect information.
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1].
# The code block below is used to handle the imperfect information.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the payoffs for each outcome.
# If both choose "Elegance Boutique", Player 1 (who prefers Elegance Boutique) gets a higher payoff.
# If both choose "Chic Couture", Player 2 (who prefers Chic Couture) gets a higher payoff.
# If they choose different options, both get no payoff.

# Both choose "Elegance Boutique"

# Both choose "Chic Couture"

# Different choices, no payoff
