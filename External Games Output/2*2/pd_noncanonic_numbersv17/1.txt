```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, both making decisions simultaneously.
# Each player has two actions: Collaborate or Hoard.

# Step 2: Since the players move simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# To model the game with a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 3: The starting node, g.root, is the first player's decision node.
# The first player has two actions, Collaborate and Hoard.

# Step 4: The second player's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1],
# which correspond to the first player's actions Collaborate and Hoard.

# Step 5: The second player, moving simultaneously, does not know which action the first player has taken.
# Therefore, the second player's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the second player's decision nodes.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 2: Assume Farmer 1 moves first. Farmer 1 has two actions: Collaborate or Hoard.
g.append_move(g.root, "Farmer 1", ["Collaborate", "Hoard"])

# Step 3: Farmer 2 moves second. Farmer 2 also has two actions: Collaborate or Hoard.
# Append moves for Farmer 2 at both decision nodes resulting from Farmer 1's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Farmer 2", ["Collaborate", "Hoard"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Farmer 2", ["Collaborate", "Hoard"])

# Group Farmer 2's decision nodes in the same information set to reflect imperfect information.
# Use the IDENTICAL CODE provided to set the information set.
