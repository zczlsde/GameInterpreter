# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. The game involves two players making decisions simultaneously, which means there is imperfect information.
# 2. To model this game with a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# 3. Let's assume the fantasy enthusiast moves first and the historical fiction enthusiast moves second.
# 4. The starting node, g.root, is the fantasy enthusiast's decision node.
# 5. The fantasy enthusiast has two actions: choose Fantasy or Historical Fiction.
# 6. The historical fiction enthusiast's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Fantasy) and g.root.children[1] (Historical Fiction).
# 7. Since the historical fiction enthusiast cannot distinguish between the fantasy enthusiast choosing Fantasy or Historical Fiction, 
#    these decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the historical fiction enthusiast's decision nodes
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Fantasy Enthusiast and Historical Fiction Enthusiast.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Fantasy Enthusiast", "Historical Fiction Enthusiast"],
                      title="Co-writing Book Genre Decision")

# Step 2: Assume the Fantasy Enthusiast moves first. They have two actions: "Fantasy" and "Historical Fiction".
g.append_move(g.root, "Fantasy Enthusiast", ["Fantasy", "Historical Fiction"])

# Step 3: The Historical Fiction Enthusiast moves second. They also have two actions: "Fantasy" and "Historical Fiction".
# Append moves for the Historical Fiction Enthusiast at both decision nodes created by the Fantasy Enthusiast's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Historical Fiction Enthusiast", ["Fantasy", "Historical Fiction"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Historical Fiction Enthusiast", ["Fantasy", "Historical Fiction"])

# Step 4: Set the information set for the Historical Fiction Enthusiast's decision nodes to reflect imperfect information.
# The Historical Fiction Enthusiast cannot distinguish between the Fantasy Enthusiast choosing "Fantasy" or "Historical Fiction".
# Use the provided code block to set the information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the payoffs for each outcome.
# If both choose "Fantasy", the Fantasy Enthusiast gets a higher payoff, and the Historical Fiction Enthusiast gets a lower payoff.
fantasy_outcome = g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Fantasy")

# If both choose "Historical Fiction", the Historical Fiction Enthusiast gets a higher payoff, and the Fantasy Enthusiast gets a lower payoff.
historical_outcome = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Historical Fiction")

# If they choose different genres, they both get no payoff.
no_payoff_outcome = g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Different genres")

# Step 6: Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], fantasy_outcome)  # Both choose Fantasy
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], no_payoff_outcome)  # Different genres
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], no_payoff_outcome)  # Different genres
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], historical_outcome)  # Both choose Historical Fiction

# Save the EFG
efg = g.write(format='native')
