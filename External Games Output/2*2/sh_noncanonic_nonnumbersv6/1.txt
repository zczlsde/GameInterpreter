```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, General 1 and General 2.
# Both players have two actions: "Joint Attack" and "Independent Mission".

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since the generals must decide simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# To model the game with a sequential structure, assume General 1 moves first and General 2 moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is General 1's decision node.
# General 1 has two actions, "Joint Attack" and "Independent Mission".
# General 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to General 1's actions "Joint Attack" and "Independent Mission".

# Step 4: Group the decision nodes into information sets.
# General 2, moving simultaneously, does not know which action General 1 has taken.
# Therefore, General 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players: General 1 and General 2.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["General 1", "General 2"],
                      title="Generals' Coordination Game")

# Step 2: General 1 makes the first move with two possible actions: "Joint Attack" and "Independent Mission".
g.append_move(g.root, "General 1", ["Joint Attack", "Independent Mission"])

# Step 3: General 2 makes a move after General 1, but does not know General 1's action.
# General 2 has the same two actions: "Joint Attack" and "Independent Mission".
# We append moves for General 2 at both of General 1's decision nodes.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "General 2", ["Joint Attack", "Independent Mission"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "General 2", ["Joint Attack", "Independent Mission"])

# Step 4: Set the information set for General 2's decision nodes to reflect imperfect information.
# General 2 does not know which action General 1 has taken, so we group the decision nodes in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the outcomes for each possible combination of actions.
# Both generals choose "Joint Attack": decisive victory with strategic advantage.
decisive_victory = g.add_outcome([3, 3], label="Decisive Victory")

# General 1 chooses "Joint Attack", General 2 chooses "Independent Mission": General 1 exposed, General 2 modest victory.

# General 1 chooses "Independent Mission", General 2 chooses "Joint Attack": General 2 exposed, General 1 modest victory.
general2_exposed = g.add_outcome([2, 0], label="General 2 Exposed")

# Both generals choose "Independent Mission": minor successes, no significant impact.
minor_successes = g.add_outcome([1, 1], label="Minor Successes")

# Step 6: Assign the outcomes to the terminal nodes of the game tree.
