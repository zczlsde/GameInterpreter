```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, each with two actions: "High Emissions" and "Cuts".

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# The game is simultaneous, meaning both players choose their actions without knowing the other's choice.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes for Player 2.
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to Player 1's actions "High Emissions" and "Cuts".

# Step 5: Group Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Player 2 does not know Player 1's action, these nodes should be in the same information set.

# Assume Country A moves first and Country B moves second.

# Step 3: Country A's move: "High Emissions" or "Cuts".

# Step 4: Country B's move: "High Emissions" or "Cuts".

g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Country B", ["High Emissions", "Cuts"])

# Step 6: Define the outcomes based on the actions chosen by both countries.
# If both choose "Cuts", the outcome is neutral with payoffs [0, 0].
neutral_outcome = g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Both Cuts")
