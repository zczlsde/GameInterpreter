# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, each can either Compromise or Hold Firm.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, this involves imperfect information.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is Player 1's decision node.
# Player 1 has two actions, Compromise and Hold Firm.
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Player 1's actions Compromise and Hold Firm.

# Step 5: Group Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Player 2 does not know Player 1's action, Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.append_move(g.root, "Politician 1", ["Compromise", "Hold Firm"])

# Step 3: Politician 2 makes a move after Politician 1, with the same actions: Compromise or Hold Firm.
# Politician 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to Politician 1's actions.
