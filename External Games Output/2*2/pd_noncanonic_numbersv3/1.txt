# Thought process:
# 1. This is a simultaneous move game between two tech companies, which means both companies make their decisions without knowing the other's choice.
# 2. To model this game with a sequential structure, assume one company moves first and the other moves second.
# 3. The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the first company.
# 4. The first company has two actions: Cut Prices or Not Cut Prices.
# 5. The second company's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Cut Prices) and g.root.children[1] (Not Cut Prices).
# 6. Since the second company cannot distinguish between the first company cutting prices or not, the second company's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the second company's decision nodes
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
