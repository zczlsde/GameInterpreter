# Thought process:
# This game involves imperfect information because the candidates must decide simultaneously whether to collaborate or focus on personal gain.
# To model the game with a sequential structure, assume Candidate 1 moves first and Candidate 2 moves second.
# The starting node, g.root, is Candidate 1's decision node.
# Candidate 1 has two actions: Collaborate or Focus on personal gain.
# Candidate 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Candidate 1's actions Collaborate and Focus on personal gain.
# Candidate 2, moving simultaneously, does not know which action Candidate 1 has taken.
# Therefore, Candidate 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
