# Step-by-step thought process:

# 1. The game involves two politicians making decisions simultaneously, which implies imperfect information.
# 2. To model this game sequentially, assume one politician moves first and the other moves second.
# 3. The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the first politician.
# 4. The first politician has two actions: Support or Oppose.
# 5. The second politician's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the first politician's actions.
# 6. Since the second politician does not know the first politician's action, their decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the second politician's decision nodes
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
