```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, and they can either work together or focus on individual skills.

# Step 2: Determine the sequence of moves.
# Since the players make their decisions simultaneously, we need to model this as a sequential game with imperfect information.

# Step 3: Assume one player moves first and the other second.
# Let's assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes for Player 2.
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to Player 1's actions (work together or focus individually).

# Step 5: Group Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Player 2 does not know Player 1's action, these nodes should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 2: Define the actions for Player 1.
# Player 1 can choose to either "Work Together" or "Focus Individually".
g.append_move(g.root, "Player 1", ["Work Together", "Focus Individually"])

# Step 3: Define the actions for Player 2.
# Player 2 can also choose to either "Work Together" or "Focus Individually".
# Since Player 2's decision is made without knowing Player 1's action, we need to set the information set later.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Player 2", ["Work Together", "Focus Individually"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Player 2", ["Work Together", "Focus Individually"])

# Step 4: Set the information set for Player 2's decision nodes.
# Player 2 does not know Player 1's action, so we group Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Both work together: Team wins, both players gain fame and lucrative contracts.

# Both focus individually: Team performance suffers, lower ranking and limited rewards.
outcome_team_suffers = g.add_outcome([1, 1], label="Team Suffers")

# Step 6: Assign the outcomes to the terminal nodes.
