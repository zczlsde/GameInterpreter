# Thought process:
# The game involves two directors making decisions simultaneously about whether to commit to the project or not.
# Since they make decisions simultaneously, this involves imperfect information.
# To model this game with a sequential structure, assume Director 1 moves first and Director 2 moves second.
# The starting node, g.root, is Director 1's decision node.
# Director 1 has two actions: Commit or Not Commit.
# Director 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Director 1's actions Commit and Not Commit.
# Director 2, moving simultaneously, does not know which action Director 1 has taken.
# Therefore, Director 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

g.append_move(g.root, "Director 1", ["Commit", "Not Commit"])

# Director 2 makes the second move, but since the moves are simultaneous, we model it as if Director 2 moves after Director 1
# Director 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to Director 1's actions
