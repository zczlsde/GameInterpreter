# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the small electric vehicle company and the large traditional car manufacturer.
# Both players decide simultaneously whether to invest in developing a new electric sedan or a new electric SUV.

# Step 2: Recognize the simultaneous move nature of the game.
# Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the large manufacturer moves first and the small company moves second.
# The starting node, g.root, is the large manufacturer's decision node.

# Step 4: Define the decision nodes for the small company.
# The large manufacturer has two actions: sedan and SUV.
# The small company's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (sedan) and g.root.children[1] (SUV).

# Step 5: Group the small company's decision nodes in the same information set.
# The small company, moving simultaneously, does not know which action the large manufacturer has taken.
# Therefore, the small company's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
