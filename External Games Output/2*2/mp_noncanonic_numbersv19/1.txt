```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the renewable energy startup and the traditional energy company.
# Both players decide simultaneously whether to invest in wind power or solar power.

# Step 2: Recognize the simultaneous move nature of the game.
# Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the traditional energy company moves first and the renewable startup moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes for the renewable startup.
# The starting node, g.root, is the traditional energy company's decision node.
# The traditional energy company has two actions: invest in wind power or solar power.
# The renewable startup's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the traditional energy company's actions.

# Step 5: Group the renewable startup's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the renewable startup does not know which action the traditional energy company has taken, these nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the Traditional Energy Company moves first and the Renewable Startup moves second.

# Step 3: Add the move for the Traditional Energy Company.
# The Traditional Energy Company has two actions: invest in wind power or solar power.
g.append_move(g.root, "Traditional Energy Company", ["Invest in Wind", "Invest in Solar"])

# Step 4: Add the move for the Renewable Startup.
# The Renewable Startup also has two actions: invest in wind power or solar power.
