```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, and they are contemplating signing a mutual defense pact.
# Each player has two actions: Sign or Not sign.

# Step 2: Determine the nature of the game.
# The game is simultaneous because both players decide whether to sign or not at the same time.
# This means there is imperfect information, as each player does not know the other's decision when making their own.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second for modeling purposes.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is Player 1's decision node.
# Player 1 has two actions, Sign and Not sign, leading to two decision nodes for Player 2: 
# g.root.children[0] (Player 1 signs) and g.root.children[1] (Player 1 does not sign).

# Step 5: Group Player 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Player 2 does not know Player 1's action when making their decision, 
# Player 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Nation 1", "Nation 2"],
                      title="Mutual Defense Pact Game")

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure for simplicity.
# Assume Nation 1 moves first and Nation 2 moves second for modeling purposes.

# Step 3: Append moves for Nation 1 at the root node.
# Nation 1 has two actions: Sign or Not sign.
g.append_move(g.root, "Nation 1", ["Sign", "Not sign"])

# Step 4: Append moves for Nation 2 at each of Nation 1's decision nodes.
# Nation 2 also has two actions: Sign or Not sign.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Nation 2", ["Sign", "Not sign"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Nation 2", ["Sign", "Not sign"])

# Step 5: Group Nation 2's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since Nation 2 does not know Nation 1's action when making their decision,
# Nation 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 6: Define the outcomes for each terminal node.
# If both sign, they gain 4 points each.
both_sign = g.add_outcome([4, 4], label="Both sign")

# If Nation 1 signs and Nation 2 does not, Nation 1 gains 0 points, Nation 2 gains 2 points.
nation1_signs = g.add_outcome([0, 2], label="Nation 1 signs, Nation 2 does not")

# If Nation 1 does not sign and Nation 2 signs, Nation 1 gains 2 points, Nation 2 gains 0 points.
nation2_signs = g.add_outcome([2, 0], label="Nation 2 signs, Nation 1 does not")

# If neither sign, they both gain 1 point.
neither_sign = g.add_outcome([1, 1], label="Neither sign")

# Step 7: Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
