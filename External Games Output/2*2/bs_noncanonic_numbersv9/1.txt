```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, both deciding on a location simultaneously.

# Step 2: Recognize the imperfect information.
# Since both players decide simultaneously, neither knows the other's choice at the time of decision.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume one player moves first, and the other moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes for the second player.
# The second player's decision nodes are based on the first player's actions.

# Step 5: Group the decision nodes of the second player in the same information set.
# Since the second player does not know the first player's choice, their decision nodes should be in the same information set.

# Assuming Player 1 moves first and Player 2 moves second:
# Player 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (if Player 1 chooses "Grand Conference Hall")
# and g.root.children[1] (if Player 1 chooses "Tech Innovation Center").

# Group these nodes in the same information set for Player 2.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players.
# The players are "Hall Advocate" and "Tech Advocate".

                      title="Strategy Session Location Decision")

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume "Hall Advocate" moves first, choosing between "Grand Conference Hall" and "Tech Innovation Center".
g.append_move(g.root, "Hall Advocate", ["Grand Conference Hall", "Tech Innovation Center"])

# Step 3: The "Tech Advocate" moves second, choosing between the same options.
# Append moves for "Tech Advocate" based on the "Hall Advocate"'s choice.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Tech Advocate", ["Grand Conference Hall", "Tech Innovation Center"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Tech Advocate", ["Grand Conference Hall", "Tech Innovation Center"])

# Step 4: Set the outcomes for each possible decision path.
# If both choose "Grand Conference Hall", the hall advocate gets 2 points, and the tech advocate gets 1 point.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Grand Conference Hall"))

# If "Hall Advocate" chooses "Grand Conference Hall" and "Tech Advocate" chooses "Tech Innovation Center",
# they hold separate sessions and gain 0 points each.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Separate sessions"))

# If "Hall Advocate" chooses "Tech Innovation Center" and "Tech Advocate" chooses "Grand Conference Hall",
# they hold separate sessions and gain 0 points each.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Separate sessions"))

# If both choose "Tech Innovation Center", the tech advocate gets 2 points, and the hall advocate gets 1 point.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Tech Innovation Center"))

# Step 5: Handle the imperfect information.
# Since both players decide simultaneously, neither knows the other's choice at the time of decision.
# Group the decision nodes of the second player in the same information set.
# Use the IDENTICAL CODE provided to handle the imperfect information.
