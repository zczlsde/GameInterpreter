```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the tech startup and the tech giant.
# Both players decide simultaneously between launching a smart home device or a wearable gadget.

# Step 2: Recognize the imperfect information.
# Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, neither player knows the other's choice at the time of making their own decision.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the tech giant moves first and the tech startup moves second.
# The tech startup's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the tech giant's actions.

# Step 4: Group the tech startup's decision nodes in the same information set.
# The tech startup cannot distinguish between the tech giant choosing a smart home device or a wearable gadget.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the tech giant moves first and the tech startup moves second.
# The tech giant has two actions: launch a smart home device or a wearable gadget.
g.append_move(g.root, "Tech Giant", ["Smart Home Device", "Wearable Gadget"])

# Step 3: The tech startup also has two actions: launch a smart home device or a wearable gadget.
# The tech startup's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the tech giant's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Tech Startup", ["Smart Home Device", "Wearable Gadget"])

# The tech startup cannot distinguish between the tech giant choosing a smart home device or a wearable gadget.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Set the outcomes based on the players' choices.
# If both choose the same product, the startup wins 3 points, and the tech giant loses 3 points.
# If their choices differ, the tech giant wins 4 points, and the startup loses 4 points.

# Both choose Smart Home Device
