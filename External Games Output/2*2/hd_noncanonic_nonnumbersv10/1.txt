# Step-by-step thought process:
# 1. The game involves two players, the vendor and the retailer, who make decisions simultaneously.
# 2. Since they move simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# 3. To model the game with a sequential structure, assume the vendor moves first and the retailer moves second.
# 4. The starting node, g.root, is the vendor's decision node.
# 5. The vendor has two actions: Compromise or Hold firm.
# 6. The retailer's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Vendor Compromises) and g.root.children[1] (Vendor Holds firm).
# 7. The retailer, moving simultaneously, does not know which action the vendor has taken.
# 8. Therefore, the retailer's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players: Vendor and Retailer.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Vendor", "Retailer"],
                      title="Vendor-Retailer Negotiation Game")

# Step 2: The Vendor moves first. The Vendor has two actions: Compromise or Hold firm.
g.append_move(g.root, "Vendor", ["Compromise", "Hold firm"])

# Step 3: The Retailer moves second. The Retailer also has two actions: Compromise or Hold firm.
# The Retailer's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Vendor Compromises) and g.root.children[1] (Vendor Holds firm).
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Retailer", ["Compromise", "Hold firm"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Retailer", ["Compromise", "Hold firm"])

# Step 4: Since the game involves simultaneous moves, the Retailer does not know which action the Vendor has taken.
# Therefore, the Retailer's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the outcomes for each possible combination of actions.
# If both compromise, a fair wholesale price is agreed upon.
fair_price = g.add_outcome([1, 1], label="Fair Price")
# If the Vendor holds firm and the Retailer compromises, the Vendor gets a more favorable price.
vendor_favorable = g.add_outcome([2, 0], label="Vendor Favorable")
# If the Retailer holds firm and the Vendor compromises, the Retailer gets a more favorable price.
retailer_favorable = g.add_outcome([0, 2], label="Retailer Favorable")
# If both hold firm, no deal is made.
no_deal = g.add_outcome([-1, -1], label="No Deal")

# Step 6: Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], fair_price)  # Both Compromise
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], retailer_favorable)  # Vendor Compromises, Retailer Holds firm
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], vendor_favorable)  # Vendor Holds firm, Retailer Compromises
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], no_deal)  # Both Hold firm

# Save the EFG
