# Thought process:
# 1. This is a simultaneous move game where both the landlord and the tenant decide whether to compromise or hold firm.
# 2. Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, they do not know the other player's decision at the time of making their own decision.
# 3. To model this in a sequential structure, we can assume one player moves first, but the other player does not know the first player's action.
# 4. Therefore, both decision nodes for the second player should be in the same information set, as they cannot distinguish between the actions of the first player.

# Assuming the landlord moves first and the tenant moves second:
# The tenant's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (landlord compromises) and g.root.children[1] (landlord holds firm).
# The tenant cannot distinguish between these two nodes, so they should be in the same information set.
