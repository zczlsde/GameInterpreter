```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two warlords, each deciding independently to either attack or defend.

# Step 2: Recognize the simultaneous nature of the decisions.
# Since both warlords decide independently and simultaneously, they do not know the other's decision.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure for representation.
# Assume one warlord moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 4: Identify the decision nodes for the second warlord.
# The second warlord's decision nodes correspond to the first warlord's actions (attack or defend).

# Step 5: Group the decision nodes of the second warlord in the same information set.
# Since the second warlord does not know the first warlord's decision, their decision nodes should be in the same information set.

# Assuming Warlord 1 moves first and Warlord 2 moves second:
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
```

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players, Warlord 1 and Warlord 2.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Warlord 1", "Warlord 2"],
                      title="Strategic Outpost Conflict")

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure for representation.
# Assume Warlord 1 moves first and Warlord 2 moves second.

# Step 3: Warlord 1 has two actions: Attack or Defend.
g.append_move(g.root, "Warlord 1", ["Attack", "Defend"])

# Step 4: Warlord 2 also has two actions: Attack or Defend.
# Warlord 2's decision nodes correspond to Warlord 1's actions.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Warlord 2", ["Attack", "Defend"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Warlord 2", ["Attack", "Defend"])

# Step 5: Group the decision nodes of Warlord 2 in the same information set.
# Since Warlord 2 does not know Warlord 1's decision, their decision nodes should be in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 6: Define the outcomes based on the strategies chosen by the warlords.
# If both decide to attack or both to defend, the weaker warlord gains a strategic advantage.
# If their strategies differ, the stronger warlord consolidates their power.

# Assume Warlord 1 is the stronger warlord.
# Both attack or both defend: Warlord 2 gains advantage.
warlord2_advantage = g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Warlord 2 gains advantage")
# Different strategies: Warlord 1 consolidates power.
warlord1_consolidates = g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Warlord 1 consolidates power")

# Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], warlord2_advantage)  # Both attack
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], warlord1_consolidates)  # Warlord 1 attacks, Warlord 2 defends
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], warlord1_consolidates)  # Warlord 1 defends, Warlord 2 attacks
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], warlord2_advantage)  # Both defend

# Save the EFG
