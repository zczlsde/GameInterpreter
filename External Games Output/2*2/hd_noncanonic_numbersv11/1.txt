# Thought process:
# 1. The game involves two players, both making decisions simultaneously.
# 2. To model this in a sequential structure, assume one player moves first, and the other moves second.
# 3. Let's assume Farmer 1 moves first and Farmer 2 moves second.
# 4. Farmer 2 does not know the action taken by Farmer 1 when making their decision.
# 5. Therefore, Farmer 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Assuming Farmer 1's actions are "Share" and "Take More", and Farmer 2's actions are "Share" and "Take More".
# Farmer 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Farmer 1 chooses "Share") and g.root.children[1] (Farmer 1 chooses "Take More").

# Group Farmer 2's decision nodes in the same information set because they do not know Farmer 1's action.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
