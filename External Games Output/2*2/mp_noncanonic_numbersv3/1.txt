# Thought process:
# 1. This is a simultaneous move game between the local coffee shop and the large coffee chain.
# 2. Both players decide independently and simultaneously whether to launch a new signature latte or a new cold brew.
# 3. Since the players move simultaneously, neither player knows the other's choice at the time of making their decision.
# 4. To model this in a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# 5. The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the first player (e.g., the local coffee shop).
# 6. The first player has two actions: launch a latte or a cold brew.
# 7. The second player's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the first player's actions.
# 8. The second player, moving simultaneously, does not know which action the first player has taken.
# 9. Therefore, the second player's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Set the information set for the second player's decision nodes
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)
