# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, the comedy enthusiast and the action lover.
# Both players have two actions: choose Comedy or choose Action.

# Step 2: Determine the structure of the game.
# Since both players are deciding simultaneously, this involves imperfect information.
# To model this in a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes for each player.
# Assume the comedy enthusiast moves first, and the action lover moves second.
# The starting node, g.root, is the comedy enthusiast's decision node.
# The action lover's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Comedy) and g.root.children[1] (Action).

# Step 4: Group the decision nodes in the same information set.
# The action lover does not know the choice of the comedy enthusiast.
# Therefore, the action lover's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new game with two players: Comedy Enthusiast and Action Lover.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Comedy Enthusiast", "Action Lover"],
                      title="Roommates Movie Choice Game")

# Step 2: Model the game structure.
# Assume the Comedy Enthusiast moves first, choosing between Comedy and Action.
g.append_move(g.root, "Comedy Enthusiast", ["Comedy", "Action"])

# Step 3: The Action Lover moves second, choosing between Comedy and Action.
# The Action Lover's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] (Comedy) and g.root.children[1] (Action).
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Action Lover", ["Comedy", "Action"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Action Lover", ["Comedy", "Action"])

# Step 4: Set the information set for the Action Lover.
# The Action Lover does not know the choice of the Comedy Enthusiast.
# Therefore, the Action Lover's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the outcomes based on their choices.
# If both choose Comedy, Comedy Enthusiast gets 2 points, Action Lover gets 1 point.
comedy_agreement = g.add_outcome([2, 1], label="Both choose Comedy")
# If both choose Action, Action Lover gets 2 points, Comedy Enthusiast gets 1 point.
action_agreement = g.add_outcome([1, 2], label="Both choose Action")
# If they choose different genres, neither watches a movie, and they both score 0 points.
disagreement = g.add_outcome([0, 0], label="Different choices")

# Step 6: Set the outcomes for each terminal node.
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], comedy_agreement)  # Both choose Comedy
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], disagreement)      # Comedy Enthusiast chooses Comedy, Action Lover chooses Action
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], disagreement)      # Comedy Enthusiast chooses Action, Action Lover chooses Comedy
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[1], action_agreement)  # Both choose Action
