```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the independent bookstore and the major bookstore chain.
# Both players decide simultaneously to display either a mystery novel or a romance novel.

# Step 2: Determine the imperfect information structure.
# Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, neither player knows the other's choice at the time of their decision.
# To model this in a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# Let's assume the major bookstore chain moves first and the independent bookstore moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes for the independent bookstore.
# The major bookstore chain's decision node is the root, g.root.
# The independent bookstore's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the chain's actions (mystery or romance).

# Step 4: Group the independent bookstore's decision nodes in the same information set.
# The independent bookstore cannot distinguish between the chain choosing mystery or romance, so these nodes should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new extensive-form game with two players: the independent bookstore and the major bookstore chain.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Independent Bookstore", "Major Bookstore Chain"],
                      title="Bookstore Display Game")

# Step 2: Model the simultaneous decision-making process by assuming one player moves first.
# Let's assume the major bookstore chain moves first and the independent bookstore moves second.

# Step 3: Append moves for the major bookstore chain at the root node.
# The major bookstore chain can choose to display either a mystery novel or a romance novel.
g.append_move(g.root, "Major Bookstore Chain", ["Mystery", "Romance"])

# Step 4: Append moves for the independent bookstore at each of the major bookstore chain's decision nodes.
# The independent bookstore can also choose to display either a mystery novel or a romance novel.
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "Independent Bookstore", ["Mystery", "Romance"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "Independent Bookstore", ["Mystery", "Romance"])

# Step 5: Group the independent bookstore's decision nodes in the same information set.
# The independent bookstore cannot distinguish between the chain choosing mystery or romance, so these nodes should be in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 6: Define the outcomes based on the players' actions.
# If the displays match, the independent bookstore benefits.
# If the displays differ, the chain profits.

# Outcome when both display mystery novels.
outcome_match_mystery = g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Match Mystery")
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], outcome_match_mystery)

# Outcome when the chain displays mystery and the independent bookstore displays romance.
outcome_differ_chain_mystery = g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Differ Chain Mystery")
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], outcome_differ_chain_mystery)

# Outcome when the chain displays romance and the independent bookstore displays mystery.
outcome_differ_chain_romance = g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Differ Chain Romance")
