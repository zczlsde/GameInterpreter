# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the coach from the lesser-known college and the coach from the top university.
# Both players choose their strategies simultaneously, which means they have imperfect information about each other's choices.

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the coach from the top university moves first, and the coach from the lesser-known college moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the top university's coach.
# The top university's coach has two actions: "Aggressive Offense" and "Strong Defense".
# The decision nodes for the lesser-known college's coach are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the top university's coach's actions.

# Step 4: Group the decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the lesser-known college's coach does not know which action the top university's coach has taken, 
# the decision nodes for the lesser-known college's coach should be grouped in the same information set.

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the coach from the top university moves first, and the coach from the lesser-known college moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes.
# The starting node, g.root, is the decision node for the top university's coach.
# The top university's coach has two actions: "Aggressive Offense" and "Strong Defense".

# Step 5: Define the outcomes based on the strategies chosen by both coaches.
# If their strategies match, the lesser-known team's coach outsmarts the competition and their team gains notoriety.
# If the strategies differ, the top universityâ€™s team uses their superior resources to dominate the game.

# Matching strategies: Lesser-known team gains notoriety
lesser_known_wins = g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Lesser-known team gains notoriety")

# Different strategies: Top university team dominates
top_university_wins = g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="Top university team dominates")

# Set the outcomes for each possible combination of strategies
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], lesser_known_wins)  # Both choose Aggressive Offense
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], top_university_wins)  # Top chooses Aggressive Offense, Lesser-known chooses Strong Defense
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], top_university_wins)  # Top chooses Strong Defense, Lesser-known chooses Aggressive Offense
