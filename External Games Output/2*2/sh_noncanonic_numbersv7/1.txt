```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players, Neighbor 1 and Neighbor 2, who decide simultaneously whether to contribute or not.

# Step 2: Since the players move simultaneously, this game involves imperfect information.
# To model the game with a sequential structure, assume Neighbor 1 moves first and Neighbor 2 moves second.

# Step 3: The starting node, g.root, is Neighbor 1's decision node.
# Neighbor 1 has two actions: Contribute or Not contribute.

# Step 4: Neighbor 2's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to Neighbor 1's actions Contribute and Not contribute.

# Step 5: Neighbor 2, moving simultaneously, does not know which action Neighbor 1 has taken.
# Therefore, Neighbor 2's decision nodes should be grouped in the same information set.
