```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the niche fashion brand and the global fashion giant.
# Both players decide simultaneously between two actions: debut a new line of sustainable clothing or a new line of tech-infused apparel.

# Step 2: Recognize the imperfect information.
# Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, neither player knows the other's choice at the time of making their own decision.

# Step 3: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the global fashion giant moves first and the niche fashion brand moves second.
# The starting node, g.root, is the global fashion giant's decision node.
# The global fashion giant has two actions, sustainable clothing and tech-infused apparel.

# Step 4: Determine the decision nodes for the niche fashion brand.
# The niche fashion brand's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to the global fashion giant's actions.

# Step 5: Group the niche fashion brand's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the niche fashion brand does not know which action the global fashion giant has taken, these nodes should be grouped in the same information set.

# Step 2: Model the game with a sequential structure.
# Assume the global fashion giant moves first and the niche fashion brand moves second.
# The starting node, g.root, is the global fashion giant's decision node.
# The global fashion giant has two actions: debut a new line of sustainable clothing or a new line of tech-infused apparel.
g.append_move(g.root, "Global Fashion Giant", ["Sustainable Clothing", "Tech-infused Apparel"])

# Step 3: Determine the decision nodes for the niche fashion brand.
# The niche fashion brand's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], which correspond to the global fashion giant's actions.

# Step 5: Set the outcomes for each possible combination of actions.
# If both opt for the same type of clothing line, the niche brand wins 1 point, and the global giant loses 1 point.
# If their choices differ, the global giant wins 2 points, and the niche brand loses 2 points.

# Both choose Sustainable Clothing
