```python
# Step 1: Identify the players and their actions.
# There are two players: the local store and the national retail chain.
# Both players decide simultaneously whether to run a discount on electronics or clothing.

# Step 2: Determine the imperfect information structure.
# Since both players make their decisions simultaneously, neither player knows the other's choice at the time of their decision.
# To model this in a sequential structure, assume one player moves first and the other moves second.
# Let's assume the local store moves first and the national retail chain moves second.

# Step 3: Identify the decision nodes for the national retail chain.
# The national retail chain's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1], corresponding to the local store's actions (electronics and clothing).

# Step 4: Group the national retail chain's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the national retail chain cannot distinguish between the local store choosing electronics or clothing, these nodes should be in the same information set.

g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

```python
import pygambit as gbt

# Step 1: Create a new game with two players: the local store and the national retail chain.
g = gbt.Game.new_tree(players=["Local Store", "National Retail Chain"],
                      title="Holiday Sale Discount Game")

# Step 2: The local store moves first, deciding between running a discount on electronics or clothing.
g.append_move(g.root, "Local Store", ["Electronics", "Clothing"])

# Step 3: The national retail chain moves second, also deciding between running a discount on electronics or clothing.
# The national retail chain's decision nodes are g.root.children[0] and g.root.children[1],
# corresponding to the local store's actions (electronics and clothing).
g.append_move(g.root.children[0], "National Retail Chain", ["Electronics", "Clothing"])
g.append_move(g.root.children[1], "National Retail Chain", ["Electronics", "Clothing"])

# Step 4: Group the national retail chain's decision nodes in the same information set.
# Since the national retail chain cannot distinguish between the local store choosing electronics or clothing,
# these nodes should be in the same information set.
g.set_infoset(g.root.children[0], g.root.children[1].infoset)

# Step 5: Define the outcomes based on the players' choices.
# If both choose the same category, the local store benefits at the expense of the national chain.
# If their promotions don't align, the national chain captures more market share.

# Both choose electronics
local_benefits = g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Local benefits")
# Both choose clothing
local_benefits_clothing = g.add_outcome([1, -1], label="Local benefits")
# Local chooses electronics, national chooses clothing
national_benefits = g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="National benefits")
# Local chooses clothing, national chooses electronics
national_benefits_clothing = g.add_outcome([-1, 1], label="National benefits")

# Set the outcomes for each terminal node
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[0], local_benefits)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[0].children[1], national_benefits)
g.set_outcome(g.root.children[1].children[0], national_benefits_clothing)
