A new manufacturer plans to enter the market, and its strength, determined by chance (not as a player decision), can be either strong (S) with probability 2/3 or weak (W) with probability 1/3. The new manufacturer will then send a signal, either strong (S) or weak (W). The current manufacturer does not know the new manufacturerâ€™s actual strength but observes the signal, which could indicate either strong (S) or weak (W). Based on this signal, the current manufacturer must decide to either compete aggressively (F) or accommodate the new competitor (A). The payoffs for each scenario are as follows:
If the new manufacturer is strong and sends a strong signal, and the existing manufacturer chooses to fight, the payoffs are (1, 0) for the new and existing manufacturers, respectively. If the existing manufacturer adapts, the payoffs are (3, 1).
If the new manufacturer is strong and sends a weak signal, and the existing manufacturer chooses to fight, the payoff is (0, 0). If the existing manufacturer adapts, the payoff is (2, 1).
If the new manufacturer is weak and sends a strong signal, and the existing manufacturer chooses to fight, the payoff is (0, 2). If the existing manufacturer adapts, the payoff is (2, 1).
If the new manufacturer is weak and sends a weak signal, and the existing manufacturer chooses to fight, the payoff is (1, 2). If the existing manufacturer adapts, the payoff is (3, 1).
