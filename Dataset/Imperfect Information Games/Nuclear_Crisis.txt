After Country B provokes Country A, a sequence of decisions unfolds. Country A must first decide to either escalate (E) the situation or ignore it (I) and end the game. If Country A ignores the provocation, both countries receive a small positive payoff.
If Country A escalates (E), Country B then faces the choice to either back down (B) with a small payoff loss while Country A gains a small payoff or to escalate further (E). 
If both Country A and Country B choose to escalate (E), this brings about a nuclear crisis. Country A then chooses first between retreating (R) and losing credibility or detonating (D). Country B, unaware of Country Aâ€™s decision, then decides to retreat (R) and lose credibility or detonate (D).
If one country detonates while the other retreats, the detonating country gains a large positive payoff, while the retreating country incurs a large negative payoff. However, if neither country retreats, retaliation follows the first nuclear strike, resulting in a catastrophic nuclear disaster, yielding a very large negative payoff for both countries. If both countries retreat, they each suffer a small negative payoff.
