Consider a three-stage game. 
In the first stage, a chance event randomly selects either "L" or "R", each with a probability of 1/2. 
In the second stage, Player 1 observes this outcome and then selects either l or r. 
By the third stage, Player 1 must choose between "A", and "B", but at this point, she has forgotten the outcome of the first stage and only remembers her decision from the second stage. 
The payoffs in all outcomes are set to 0.
