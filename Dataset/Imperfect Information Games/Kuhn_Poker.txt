This is a two-player card game between Alice and Bob, using a deck of only three cards: a King, Queen, and Jack. 
Each player contributes 1 to the pot at the start. 

Each player is dealt one of the three cards, and the third is put aside unseen by a chance node.
There are six possible allocations of the cards, each with probability 1/6: JQ, JK, QJ, QK, KJ, and KQ.

The game proceeds as follows for each of the six possible allocations:
Alice can check or bet 1, WITHOUT knowing the allocation of the chance node.

    If Alice checks then Bob can check or bet 1, WITHOUT knowing Aliceâ€™s card.
        If Bob checks, the game ends (i.e. the higher card wins 1 from the other player).

        If Bob bets then Alice can fold or call, WITHOUT knowing Bob's card.
            If Alice folds then Bob takes the pot of 3 (i.e. winning 1 from player 1).
            If Alice calls, the game ends. (i.e. the higher card wins 2 from the other player).
            
    If Alice bets then Bob can fold or call, WITHOUT knowing the Alice's card.
        If Bob folds then Alice takes the pot of 3 (i.e. winning 1 from player 2).
        If Bob calls, the game ends. (i.e. the higher card wins 2 from the other player).
