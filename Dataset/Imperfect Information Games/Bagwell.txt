In this game, Player 1, the leader, first selects a strategy: either "S" or "C." Player 2, the follower, then tries to interpret Player 1's choice, but there is a small probability of misinterpretation (e.g., if Player 1 selects S, thereâ€™s a 1% chance that Player 2 will perceive it as C). Based on what Player 2 believes Player 1 chose, Player 2 then picks either "S" or "C." 
The resulting payoffs for each player are based on the chosen combination (Player 1's actual selection, not Player 2's interpretation): if both choose S, the payoff is (A, B); if Player 1 chooses S and Player 2 chooses C, it is (W, D); if Player 1 chooses C and Player 2 chooses S, it is (E, W); and if both choose C, the payoff is (F, F). The payoff rankings from highest to lowest are: E (highest), A, F, W, B, and D (lowest). Assign values to each of these payoffs and set all the outcomes.
