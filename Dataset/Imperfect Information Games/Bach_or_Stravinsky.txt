The "Bach or Stravinsky?" game involves two players, Alexis and Beverley, who want to attend a concert together. Alexis prefers Bach, while Beverley prefers Stravinsky. Both players make their choice between Bach and Stravinsky simultaneously and independently. If they both choose Bach, Alexis, the Bach enthusiast, receives a higher payoff, while Beverley receives a lower payoff. Conversely, if they both choose Stravinsky, Beverley, who favors Stravinsky, receives a higher payoff, and Alexis receives a lower payoff. If they choose different concerts, neither player receives any payoff.
