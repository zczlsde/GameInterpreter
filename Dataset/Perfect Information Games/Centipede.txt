Consider a game with two players, Alice and Bob, where Alice makes the first move. At the start, Alice has two piles of coins in front of her: one pile with 4 coins and another with 1 coin. Each player has two options on their turn: they can either take the larger pile, giving the smaller pile to the other player, or they can push both piles to the other player. Whenever the piles are pushed across the table, the number of coins in each pile doubles. For instance, if Alice chooses to push on her first turn, the piles of 1 and 4 coins are handed over to Bob, increasing to 2 and 8 coins. Bob can then decide either to take the pile of 8 coins and leave 2 for Alice or to push the piles back to Alice, further doubling them to 4 and 16 coins (The last push will not double the coin). If neither player takes the coins by the end of the game, Alice will receive the pile with the higher value, and Bob will get the one with the lower value. 
The game has four moves in total: Alice moves (take or push), Bob moves (take or push, where the final push also doubles the piles before the game ends), Alice moves again, and finally, Bob moves. All actions are visible to both players.
