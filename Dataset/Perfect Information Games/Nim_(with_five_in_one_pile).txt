The game involves a single pile of five stones, with two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns. On each turn, a player can remove either one or two stones (but only one stone if only one remains). The goal is to avoid taking the last stone.
Hereâ€™s how the moves unfold:
Alice starts and can choose to remove one or two stones.
   If Alice removes one stone, Bob can also remove one or two stones.
      If Bob removes one stone, Alice can again choose to remove one or two stones.
         If Alice removes one stone, Bob has the choice to remove one or two stones.
            If Bob removes one stone, Alice can remove one stone, which would result in Alice losing the game.
            If Bob removes two stones, Bob loses the game.
         If Alice removes two stones, Bob can remove one stone, leading to Bob's loss.
      If Bob removes two stones, Alice can remove one or two stones.
         If Alice removes one stone, Bob can remove one stone, leading to Bob's loss.
         If Alice removes two stones, Alice loses the game.
   If Alice removes two stones, Bob has the option to remove one or two stones.
      If Bob removes one stone, Alice can remove one or two stones.
         If Alice removes one stone, Bob can remove one stone, leading to Bob's loss.
         If Alice removes two stones, Alice loses the game.
      If Bob removes two stones, Alice has only one stone left and loses.

In this game, the winner earns one point, while the loser loses one point.
