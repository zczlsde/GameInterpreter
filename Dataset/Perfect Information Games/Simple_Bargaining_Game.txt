A and B are negotiating how to split 10,000 pounds in cash, following these rules: First, A proposes a plan where A receives 5,500 pounds, and B receives 4,500 pounds. If B accepts, the negotiation concludes, with A getting 5,500 pounds and B getting 4,500 pounds. If B rejects, B then proposes an equal split of 5,000 pounds each. If A accepts B’s offer, both players finalize the negotiation with each receiving 4,750 pounds. If A rejects B’s offer, A proposes a new split where A receives 5,200 pounds, and B receives 4,800 pounds. Here, B has no choice but to accept, resulting in A receiving 4,693 pounds and B receiving 4,332 pounds.
The final amount each player receives is their payoff in the negotiation.
